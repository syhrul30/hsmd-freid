  "Everything I own is in the trunk of that car.",
  "I have spent the last month sleeping in the backseat.",

  "While Nina Winchester drones on about the exact height and weight requirements for car seats, I take a moment to glance around the living room.",
  "The furnishing is all ultra-modern, with the largest flat-screen television I’ve ever seen, which I’m sure is high definition and has surround-sound speakers built into every nook and cranny of the room for optimal listening experience.",
  "In the corner of the room is what appears to be a working fireplace, the mantle littered with photographs of the Winchesters on trips to every corner of the world.",
  "When I glance up, the insanely high ceiling glows under the light of a sparkling chandelier.",

  "I swallow.",
  "The number in the advertisement is more than acceptable.",
  "If I were a cartoon character, dollar signs would have appeared in each of my eyeballs when I read that advertisement.",

  "Nobody offering that much money, living in a house like this one, would ever consider hiring me.",

  "",
  "I stand up as well.",
  "In her heels, Mrs. Winchester is only a few inches taller than I am in my flats, but it feels like she’s much taller.",
  "“Sounds great!”",
  "",
  "She guides me through the house in painstaking detail, to the point where I’m worried I got the ad wrong and maybe she’s a realtor thinking I’m ready to buy.",
  "It is a beautiful house.",
  "If I had four or five million dollars burning a hole in my pocket, I would snap it up.",
  "In addition to the ground level containing the gigantic living room and the newly renovated kitchen, the second floor of the house features the Winchesters’ master bedroom, her daughter Cecelia’s room, Mr. Winchester’s home office, and a guest bedroom that could be straight out of the best hotel in Manhattan.",
  "She pauses dramatically in front of the subsequent door.",
  "",
  "“And here is…” She flings the door open.",
  "“Our home theater!”",
  "",
  "It’s a legit movie theater right inside their home—in addition to the oversized television downstairs.",
  "This room has several rows of stadium seating, facing a floor-to-ceiling monitor.",
  "There’s even a popcorn machine in the corner of the room.",
  "",
  "After a moment, I notice Mrs. Winchester is looking at me, waiting for a response.",
  "",
  "“Wow!” I say with what I hope is appropriate enthusiasm.",
  "",
  "“Isn’t it marvelous?”",
  "She shivers with delight.",
  "“And we have a full library of movies to choose from.",
  "Of course, we also have all the usual channels as well as streaming services.”",

  "“Of course,” I say.",

  "After we leave the room, we come to a final door at the end of the hallway.",
  "Nina pauses, her hand lingering on the doorknob.",
  "",
  "“Would this be my room?” I ask.",
  "",
  "“Sort of…” She turns the doorknob, which creaks loudly.",
  "I can’t help but notice the wood of this door is much thicker than any of the others.",
  "Behind the doorway, there’s a dark stairwell.",
  "“Your room is upstairs.",
  "We have a finished attic as well.”",
  "",
  "This dark, narrow staircase is somewhat less glamorous than the rest of the house—and would it kill them to stick a lightbulb in here?",
  "But of course, I’m the hired help.",
  "I wouldn’t expect her to spend as much money on my room as she would on the home theater.",
  "",
  "At the top of the stairs is a little narrow hallway.",
  "Unlike on the first floor of the house, the ceiling is dangerously low here.",
  "I’m not tall by any means, but I almost feel like I need to stoop down.",
  "",
  "“You have your own bathroom.”",
  "She nods at a door on the left.",
  "“And this would be your room right here.”",
  "",
  "She flings open the last door.",
  "It’s completely dark inside until she tugs on a string and the room lights up.",
  "",
  "The room is tiny.",
  "There’s no two ways about it.",
  "Not only that, but the ceiling is slanted with the roof of the house.",
  "The far side of the ceiling only comes about up to my waist.",
  "Instead of the huge king-size bed in the Winchesters’ master bedroom with their armoire and chestnut vanity table, this room contains a small single cot, a half-height bookcase, and a small dresser, lit by two naked bulbs suspended from the ceiling.",
  "",
  "This room is modest, but that’s fine with me.",
  "If it were too nice, it would be a certainty I have no shot at this job.",
  "The fact that this room is kind of crappy means maybe her standards are low enough that I have a teeny, tiny chance.",
  "",
  "But there’s something else about this room.",
  "Something that’s bothering me.",
  "",
  "“Sorry it’s small.”",
  "Mrs. Winchester pulls a frown.",
  "“But you’ll have a lot of privacy here.”",
  "",
  "I walk over to the single window.",
  "Like the room, it’s small.",
  "Barely larger than my hand.",
  "And it overlooks the backyard.",
  "There’s a landscaper down there—the same guy I saw out at the front—hacking at one of the hedges with an oversized set of clippers.",
  "",
  "“So what do you think, Millie?",
  "Do you like it?”",
  "",
  "I turn away from the window to look at Mrs. Winchester’s smiling face.",
  "I still can’t quite put my finger on what’s bothering me.",
  "There’s something about this room that’s making a little ball of dread form in the pit of my stomach.",
  "",
  "Maybe it’s the window.",
  "It looks out on the back of the house.",
  "If I were in trouble and trying to get somebody’s attention, nobody would be able to see me back here.",
  "I could scream and yell all I wanted, and nobody would hear.",
  "",
  "But who am I kidding?",
  "I would be lucky to live in this room.",
  "With my own bathroom and an actual bed where I could straighten my legs out all the way.",
  "That tiny cot looks so good compared to my car, I could cry.",
  "",
  "“It’s perfect,” I say.",
  "",
  "Mrs. Winchester seems ecstatic about my answer.",
  "She leads me back down the dark stairwell to the second floor of the house, and when I exit that stairwell, I let out a breath I didn’t realize I was holding.",
  "There was something about that room that was very scary, but if I somehow manage to get this job, I’ll get past it.",
  "Easily.",
  "",
  "My shoulders finally relax and my lips are forming another question when I hear a voice from behind us:",
  "",
  "“Mommy?”",
  "",
  "I stop short and turn around to see a little girl standing behind us in the hallway.",
  "The girl has the same light blue eyes as Nina Winchester, except a few shades paler, and her hair is so blond that it’s almost white.",
  "The girl is wearing a very pale blue dress trimmed in white lace.",
  "And she’s staring at me like she can see right through me.",
  "Right through my soul.",
  "",
  "Do you know those movies about the scary cult of, like, creepy kids who can read minds and worship the devil and live in the cornfields or something?",
  "Well, if they were casting for one of those movies, this girl would get the part.",
  "They wouldn’t even have to audition her.",
  "They would take one look at her and be like, Yes, you are creepy girl number three.",
  "",
  "“Cece!” Mrs. Winchester exclaims.",
  "“Are you back already from your ballet lesson?”",
  "",
  "The girl nods slowly.",
  "“Bella’s mom dropped me off.”",
  "",
  "Mrs. Winchester wraps her arms around the girl’s skinny shoulders, but the girl’s expression never changes and her pale blue eyes never leave my face.",
  "Is there something wrong with me that I am scared this nine-year-old girl is going to murder me?",
  "",
  "“This is Millie,” Mrs. Winchester tells her daughter.",
  "“Millie, this is my daughter, Cecelia.”",
  "",
  "Little Cecelia’s eyes are two little pools of the ocean.",
  "“It’s nice to meet you, Millie,” she says politely.",
  "",
  "I’d say there’s at least a twenty-five percent chance she’s going to murder me in my sleep if I get this job.",
  "But I still want it.",
  "",
  "Mrs. Winchester pecks her daughter on the top of her blond head, and then the little girl scurries off to her bedroom.",
  "She doubtless has a creepy doll house in there where the dolls come to life at night.",
  "Maybe one of the dolls will be the one to kill me.",
  "",
  "Okay, I’m being ridiculous.",
  "That little girl is probably extremely sweet.",
  "It’s not her fault she’s been dressed in a creepy Victorian ghost-child’s outfit.",
  "And I love kids, in general.",
  "Not that I’ve interacted with them much over the last decade.",
  "",
  "Once we get back down to the first floor, the tension leaves my body.",
  "Mrs. Winchester is nice and normal enough—for a lady this rich—and as she chatters about the house and her daughter and the job, I’m only vaguely listening.",
  "All I know is this will be a lovely place to work.",

  "Usianya akhir tiga puluhan, dan dengan gaya rambut dan pakaian yang berbeda, ia akan terlihat sangat biasa saja.",
  "Tapi ia telah menggunakan kekayaannya yang melimpah untuk memaksimalkan apa yang ia miliki.",
  "Aku harus mengakui aku menghargai hal itu.",
  "",
  "Aku justru mengambil arah yang berlawanan dalam hal penampilan.",
  "Usiaku mungkin lebih dari sepuluh tahun lebih muda dari wanita yang duduk di hadapanku, tapi aku tidak ingin ia merasa terancam olehku sedikit pun.",

  "Sementara Nina Winchester terus mengoceh tentang persyaratan tinggi dan berat badan untuk kursi mobil, aku menyempatkan diri untuk mengamati ruang keluarga.",
  "Perabotannya serba ultramodern, dengan televisi layar datar terbesar yang pernah kulihat, yang kuyakini berdefinisi tinggi dan memiliki pengeras suara *surround* yang terpasang di setiap sudut ruangan untuk pengalaman audio yang optimal.",
  "Di sudut ruangan ada perapian yang tampaknya berfungsi, bagian atasnya dipenuhi foto-foto keluarga Winchester saat berlibur ke berbagai penjuru dunia.",
  "Saat aku mendongak, langit-langit yang luar biasa tinggi itu bersinar di bawah cahaya lampu gantung yang berkilauan.",
  "",
  "”Tidakkah kau setuju, Millie?” kata Nyonya Winchester.",

  "Tidak ada orang yang menawarkan uang sebanyak itu, yang tinggal di rumah seperti ini, mau mempekerjakan aku.",

  "”Ya,” kataku tercekat.",
  "”Tidak masalah.”",

  "Ia menarik ujung roknya dan bangkit berdiri.",
  "”Kalau begitu, mau kuajak berkeliling?",
  "Melihat seperti apa tempat kerjamu nanti?”",

  "Aku pun ikut berdiri.",
  "Dengan sepatu haknya, Nyonya Winchester hanya beberapa inci lebih tinggi dariku yang memakai sepatu datar, tapi rasanya ia jauh lebih jangkung.",
  "”Tentu saja!”",
  "",
  "Ia memanduku menjelajahi rumah dengan detail yang sangat teliti, sampai-sampai aku khawatir aku salah membaca iklan dan mungkin ia adalah seorang agen properti yang mengira aku siap membeli.",
  "Rumah ini memang indah.",
  "Jika aku punya empat atau lima juta dolar yang tak tahu harus diapakan, aku akan langsung membelinya.",
  "Selain lantai dasar yang berisi ruang keluarga raksasa dan dapur yang baru direnovasi, lantai dua rumah ini memiliki kamar tidur utama keluarga Winchester, kamar putrinya Cecelia, kantor Tuan Winchester, dan kamar tamu yang seolah diambil langsung dari hotel terbaik di Manhattan.",
  "Ia berhenti secara dramatis di depan pintu berikutnya.",
  "",
  "”Dan di sini adalah…” Ia membuka pintu lebar-lebar.",
  "”Bioskop pribadi kami!”",
  "",
  "Ini benar-benar sebuah bioskop di dalam rumah mereka—selain televisi berukuran besar di lantai bawah.",
  "Ruangan ini memiliki beberapa baris kursi stadion, menghadap ke layar setinggi langit-langit.",
  "Bahkan ada mesin berondong jagung di sudut ruangan.",
  "",
  "Sesaat kemudian, aku sadar Nyonya Winchester sedang menatapku, menunggu tanggapan.",

  "”Apakah ini kamarku?” tanyaku.",
  "",
  "”Bisa dibilang begitu…” Ia memutar gagang pintu, yang berderit keras.",
  "Aku tidak bisa tidak memperhatikan bahwa kayu pintu ini jauh lebih tebal daripada pintu-pintu lainnya.",
  "Di balik pintu, ada sebuah tangga yang gelap.",
  "”Kamarmu di atas.",
  "Kami juga punya loteng yang sudah jadi.”",
  "",
  "Tangga yang gelap dan sempit ini tidak seglamor bagian rumah lainnya—dan apakah mereka akan rugi kalau memasang satu bola lampu di sini?",
  "Tapi tentu saja, aku hanyalah pembantu.",
  "Aku tidak berharap ia akan menghabiskan uang sebanyak yang ia habiskan untuk bioskop pribadinya demi kamarku.",
  "",
  "Di puncak tangga ada sebuah lorong kecil yang sempit.",
  "Tidak seperti di lantai pertama rumah, langit-langit di sini sangat rendah.",
  "Aku sama sekali tidak tinggi, tapi aku hampir merasa perlu membungkuk.",
  "",
  "”Kau punya kamar mandi sendiri.”",
  "Ia menunjuk sebuah pintu di sebelah kiri.",
  "”Dan ini kamarmu.”",
  "",
  "Ia membuka pintu terakhir.",
  "Di dalam benar-benar gelap sampai ia menarik seutas tali dan ruangan itu pun terang.",
  "",
  "Kamar itu mungil.",
  "Tidak bisa digambarkan dengan cara lain.",
  "Bukan hanya itu, tapi langit-langitnya miring mengikuti bentuk atap rumah.",
  "Sisi terjauh langit-langit itu tingginya hanya sepinggangku.",
  "Tidak seperti tempat tidur ukuran *king* di kamar tidur utama keluarga Winchester dengan lemari pakaian dan meja rias kayu *chestnut* mereka, kamar ini hanya berisi sebuah ranjang tunggal kecil, rak buku setengah tinggi, dan lemari laci kecil, diterangi oleh dua bola lampu telanjang yang tergantung di langit-langit.",
  "",
  "Kamar ini sederhana, tapi aku tidak keberatan.",
  "Jika terlalu bagus, sudah pasti aku tidak akan punya kesempatan mendapatkan pekerjaan ini.",
  "Fakta bahwa kamar ini agak jelek berarti mungkin standarnya cukup rendah sehingga aku punya sedikit, sedikit sekali, kesempatan.",

  "Tapi ada sesuatu yang lain tentang kamar ini.",
  "Sesuatu yang menggangguku.",
  "",
  "”Maaf kamarnya kecil.”",
  "Nyonya Winchester cemberut.",
  "”Tapi kau akan punya banyak privasi di sini.”",
  "",
  "Aku berjalan ke satu-satunya jendela.",
  "Seperti kamarnya, jendela itu kecil.",
  "Hanya sedikit lebih besar dari tanganku.",
  "Dan menghadap ke halaman belakang.",
  "Ada seorang tukang kebun di bawah sana—pria yang sama yang kulihat di depan—sedang memangkas salah satu pagar tanaman dengan gunting tanaman berukuran besar.",
  "",
  "”Jadi bagaimana menurutmu, Millie?",
  "Kau suka?”",
  "",
  "Aku berpaling dari jendela untuk menatap wajah Nyonya Winchester yang tersenyum.",
  "Aku masih belum bisa menemukan apa yang menggangguku.",
  "Ada sesuatu tentang ruangan ini yang membuat gumpalan kecil rasa takut terbentuk di perutku.",
  "",
  "Mungkin karena jendelanya.",
  "Menghadap ke bagian belakang rumah.",
  "Jika aku dalam masalah dan mencoba menarik perhatian seseorang, tidak ada yang akan bisa melihatku di sini.",
  "Aku bisa berteriak sepuasnya, dan tidak ada yang akan mendengar.",
  "",
  "Tapi siapa yang sedang kubohongi?",
  "Aku akan sangat beruntung bisa tinggal di kamar ini.",
  "Dengan kamar mandi sendiri dan tempat tidur sungguhan di mana aku bisa meluruskan kakiku sepenuhnya.",
  "Ranjang kecil itu terlihat sangat nyaman dibandingkan mobilku, sampai-sampai aku bisa menangis.",
  "",
  "”Sempurna,” kataku.",
  "",
  "Nyonya Winchester tampak sangat gembira dengan jawabanku.",
  "Ia menuntunku kembali menuruni tangga yang gelap ke lantai dua rumah, dan ketika aku keluar dari tangga itu, aku mengembuskan napas yang tidak kusadari kutahan.",
  "Ada sesuatu yang sangat menakutkan tentang ruangan itu, tetapi jika entah bagaimana aku berhasil mendapatkan pekerjaan ini, aku akan mengatasinya.",
  "Dengan mudah.",
  "",
  "Pundakku akhirnya rileks dan bibirku sedang membentuk pertanyaan lain ketika aku mendengar suara dari belakang kami:",
  "",
  "”Mama?”",
  "",
  "Aku berhenti mendadak dan berbalik untuk melihat seorang gadis kecil berdiri di belakang kami di lorong.",
  "Gadis itu memiliki mata biru muda yang sama dengan Nina Winchester, hanya beberapa tingkat lebih pucat, dan rambutnya begitu pirang hingga nyaris putih.",
  "Gadis itu mengenakan gaun biru yang sangat pucat berhias renda putih.",
  "Dan ia menatapku seolah bisa melihat menembus diriku.",
  "Menembus jiwaku.",
  "",
  "Kau tahu film-film tentang sekte menakutkan yang berisi anak-anak menyeramkan yang bisa membaca pikiran dan menyembah setan serta tinggal di ladang jagung atau semacamnya?",
  "Nah, jika mereka sedang mencari pemain untuk salah satu film itu, gadis ini akan mendapatkan perannya.",
  "Mereka bahkan tidak perlu mengaudisinya.",
  "Mereka akan melihatnya sekilas dan berkata, Ya, kau adalah gadis menyeramkan nomor tiga.",
  "",
  "”Cece!” seru Nyonya Winchester.",
  "”Kau sudah pulang dari les balet?”",
  "",
  "Gadis itu mengangguk pelan.",
  "”Ibunya Bella yang mengantarku.”",
  "",
  "Nyonya Winchester melingkarkan lengannya di bahu kurus gadis itu, tetapi ekspresi gadis itu tidak pernah berubah dan mata biru pucatnya tidak pernah lepas dari wajahku.",
  "Apakah ada yang salah denganku sampai-sampai aku takut gadis sembilan tahun ini akan membunuhku?",
  "",
  "”Ini Millie,” kata Nyonya Winchester kepada putrinya.",
  "”Millie, ini putriku, Cecelia.”",
  "",
  "Mata kecil Cecelia bagai dua kolam lautan.",
  "”Senang bertemu denganmu, Millie,” katanya sopan.",
  "",
  "Kuperkirakan setidaknya ada dua puluh lima persen kemungkinan ia akan membunuhku dalam tidur jika aku mendapatkan pekerjaan ini.",
  "Tapi aku tetap menginginkannya.",
  "",
  "Nyonya Winchester mengecup puncak kepala pirang putrinya, lalu gadis kecil itu bergegas ke kamarnya.",
  "Tidak diragukan lagi ia punya rumah boneka menyeramkan di sana di mana boneka-bonekanya hidup di malam hari.",
  "Mungkin salah satu boneka itu yang akan membunuhku.",
  "",
  "Oke, aku mulai konyol.",
  "Gadis kecil itu mungkin sangat manis.",
  "Bukan salahnya ia didandani dengan pakaian anak hantu zaman Victoria yang menyeramkan.",
  "Dan secara umum, aku suka anak-anak.",
  "Meskipun aku tidak banyak berinteraksi dengan mereka selama sepuluh tahun terakhir.",
  "",
  "Begitu kami kembali ke lantai pertama, ketegangan meninggalkan tubuhku.",
  "Nyonya Winchester cukup baik dan normal—untuk seorang wanita sekaya ini—dan saat ia mengobrol tentang rumah, putrinya, dan pekerjaan, aku hanya mendengarkan sambil lalu.",
  "Yang kutahu hanyalah ini akan menjadi tempat yang menyenangkan untuk bekerja.",
  "Aku rela melakukan apa saja untuk mendapatkan pekerjaan ini.",

  "”Terima kasih… Nina,” kataku.",
  "",
  "Wajahnya bersinar, meskipun itu mungkin karena rumput laut atau masker mentimun atau apa pun yang dioleskan orang kaya ke wajah mereka.",
  "Nina Winchester adalah tipe wanita yang rutin melakukan perawatan spa.",
  "”Aku punya firasat baik tentang ini, Millie.",
  "Sungguh.”",
  "",
  "Sulit untuk tidak terbawa antusiasmenya.",
  "Sulit untuk tidak merasakan secercah harapan saat ia meremas telapak tanganku yang kasar dengan telapak tangannya yang selembut bayi.",
  "Aku ingin percaya bahwa dalam beberapa hari ke depan, aku akan menerima telepon dari Nina Winchester, menawariku kesempatan untuk datang bekerja di rumahnya dan akhirnya meninggalkan Casa Nissan.",
  "Aku sangat ingin mempercayainya.",
  "",
  "Tapi apa pun yang bisa kukatakan tentang Nina, dia bukan orang bodoh.",
  "Dia tidak akan mempekerjakan seorang wanita untuk bekerja dan tinggal di rumahnya serta merawat anaknya tanpa melakukan pemeriksaan latar belakang sederhana.",
  "Dan begitu ia melakukannya…",
  "",
  "Aku menelan gumpalan di tenggorokanku.",
  "",
  "Nina Winchester mengucapkan selamat tinggal yang hangat kepadaku di pintu depan.",
  "”Terima kasih banyak sudah datang, Millie.”",
  "Ia mengulurkan tangan untuk menggenggam tanganku sekali lagi.",
  "”Aku janji kau akan segera mendapat kabar dariku.”",

  "Tidak akan.",
  "Ini akan menjadi kali terakhir aku menginjakkan kaki di rumah megah itu.",

  "I arrive at the Winchester home the next morning, after Nina has already dropped Cecelia off at school.",
  "I park outside the metal gate surrounding their property.",
  "I’ve never been in a house that was protected by a gate before, much less lived there.",
  "But this swanky Long Island neighborhood seems to be all gated houses.",
  "Considering how low the crime rate is around here, it seems like overkill, but who am I to judge?",
  "Everything else being equal, if I had a choice between a house with a gate and a house with no gate, I’d pick the gate too.",
  "",
  "The gate was open when I arrived yesterday, but today it’s closed.",
  "Locked, apparently.",
  "I stand there a moment, my two duffel bags at my feet, trying to figure out how to get inside.",
  "There doesn’t seem to be any sort of doorbell or buzzer.",
  "But that landscaper is on the property again, crouched in the dirt, a shovel in his hand.",
  "",
  "“Excuse me!” I call out.",
  "",
  "The man glances over his shoulder at me, then goes back to digging.",
  "Real nice.",
  "",
  "“Excuse me!” I say again, loud enough that he can’t ignore me.",
  "",
  "This time, he slowly, slowly gets to his feet.",
  "He’s in absolutely no hurry as he ambles across the giant front lawn to the entrance to the gate.",
  "He pulls off his thick rubber gloves and raises his eyebrows at me.",
  "",
  "“Hi!” I say, trying to hide my annoyance with him.",
  "“My name is Millie Calloway, and it’s my first day working here.",
  "I’m just trying to get inside because Mrs. Winchester is expecting me.”",
  "",
  "He doesn’t say anything.",
  "From across the yard, I had only noticed how big he is—at least a head taller than me, with biceps the size of my thighs—but up close, I realize he’s actually pretty hot.",
  "He looks to be in his mid-thirties with thick jet-black hair damp from exertion, olive skin, and rugged good looks.",
  "But his most striking feature is his eyes.",
  "His eyes are very black—so dark, I can’t distinguish the pupil from the iris.",
  "Something about his gaze makes me take a step back.",
  "",
  "“So, um, can you help me?” I ask.",
  "",
  "The man finally opens his mouth.",
  "I expect him to tell me to get lost or to show him some ID, but instead, he lets loose with a string of rapid Italian.",
  "At least, I think it’s Italian.",
  "I can’t say I know a word of the language, but I saw an Italian movie with subtitles once, and it sort of sounded like this.",
  "",
  "“Oh,” I say when he finishes his monologue.",
  "“So, um… no English?”",
  "",
  "“English?” he says in a voice so heavily accented, it’s clear what the answer is.",
  "“No.",
  "No English.”",
  "",
  "Great.",
  "I clear my throat, trying to figure out the best way to express what I need to tell him.",
  "“So I…” I point to my chest.",
  "“I am working.",
  "For Mrs. Winchester.”",
  "I point to the house.",
  "“And I need to get… inside.”",
  "Now I point to the lock on the gate.",
  "“Inside.”",
  "",
  "He just frowns at me.",
  "Great.",
  "",
  "I’m about ready to dig out my phone and call Nina when he goes off to the side, hits some sort of switch, and the gates swing open, almost in slow motion.",
  "",
  "Once the gates are open, I take a moment to gaze up at the house that will be my home for the foreseeable future.",
  "The house is two stories plus the attic, sprawling over what looks like about the length of a city block in Brooklyn.",
  "It’s almost blindingly white—possibly freshly painted—and the architecture looks contemporary, but what do I know?",
  "I just know it looks like the people living here have more money than they know what to do with.",
  "",
  "I start to pick up one of my bags, but before I can, the guy picks up both of them without even grunting and carries them to the front door for me.",
  "Those bags are very heavy—they contain literally everything I own aside from my car—so I’m grateful he volunteered to do the heavy lifting for me.",
  "",
  "“Gracias,” I say.",
  "",
  "He gives me a funny look.",
  "Hmm, that might have been Spanish.",
  "Oh well.",
  "",
  "I point to my chest.",
  "“Millie,” I say.",
  "",
  "“Millie.”",
  "He nods in understanding, then points to his own chest.",
  "“I am Enzo.”",
  "",
  "“Nice to meet you,” I say awkwardly, even though he won’t understand me.",
  "But God, if he lives here and has a job, he must have picked up a little English.",
  "",
  "“Piacere di conoscerti,” he says.",
  "",
  "I nod wordlessly.",
  "So much for making friends with the landscaping guy.",
  "",
  "“Millie,” he says again in his thick Italian accent.",
  "He looks like he has something to say, but he’s struggling with the language.",
  "“You…”",
  "",
  "He hisses a word in Italian, but as soon as we hear the front door start to unlock, Enzo hurries back to where he had been crouched in the front yard and makes himself very busy.",
  "I could just barely make out the word he said.",
  "Pericolo.",
  "Whatever that means.",
  "Maybe it means he wants a soft drink.",
  "Peri cola—now with a twist of lime!",
  "",
  "“Millie!” Nina looks delighted to see me.",
  "So delighted that she throws her arms around me and squashes me in a hug.",
  "“I’m so glad you decided to take the job.",
  "I just felt like you and I had a connection.",
  "You know?”",
  "",
  "That’s what I thought.",
  "She got a “gut feeling” about me, so she didn’t bother to do the research.",
  "Now I just have to make sure she never has any reason not to trust me.",
  "I have to be the perfect employee.",
  "“Yes, I know what you mean.",
  "I feel the same way.”",
  "",
  "“Well, come in!”",
  "",
  "Nina grabs the crook of my elbow and leads me into the house, oblivious to the fact that I’m struggling with my two pieces of luggage.",
  "Not that I would have expected her to help me.",
  "It wouldn’t have even occurred to her.",
  "",
  "I can’t help but notice when I walk inside that the house looks very different from the first time I was here.",
  "Very different.",
  "When I came for the interview, the Winchester house was immaculate—I could have eaten off any surface in the room.",
  "But now, the place looks like a pigsty.",
  "The coffee table in front of the sofa has six cups on it with varying amounts of different sticky liquids in them, about a dozen crumpled newspapers and magazines, and a dented pizza box.",
  "There’s clothing and garbage strewn all over the living room and the dining table still has the remains of dinner last night.",
  "",
  "“As you can see,” Nina says, “you haven’t arrived a moment too soon!”",
  "",
  "So Nina Winchester is a slob—that’s her secret.",
  "It’s going to take me hours to get this place in any decent condition.",
  "Maybe days.",
  "But that’s fine—I’ve been itching to do some good honest hard work.",
  "And I like that she needs me.",
  "If I can make myself invaluable to her, she’s less likely to fire me if—or when—she finds out the truth.",
  "",
  "“Let me just put my bags away,” I tell her.",
  "“And then I’ll get the entire place tidied up.”",
  "",
  "Nina lets out a happy sigh.",
  "“You are a miracle, Millie.",
  "Thank you so much.",
  "Also…” She grabs her purse off the kitchen counter and rifles around inside, finally pulling out the latest iPhone.",
  "“I got you this.",
  "I couldn’t help but notice you were using a very outdated phone.",
  "If I need to reach you, I’d like you to have a reliable means of communication.”",
  "",
  "I hesitantly wrap my fingers around the brand-new iPhone.",
  "“Wow.",
  "This is really generous of you, but I can’t afford a plan—”",
  "",
  "She waves a hand.",
  "“I added you to our family plan.",
  "It cost almost nothing.”",
  "",
  "Almost nothing?",
  "I have a feeling her definition of those two words is very different from mine.",
  "",
  "Before I can protest further, the sound of footsteps echoes on the stairs behind me.",
  "I turn around, and a man in a gray business suit is making his way down the stairwell.",
  "When he sees me standing in the living room, he stops short at the base of the stairs, as if shocked by my presence.",
  "His eyes widen further when he notices my luggage.",
  "",
  "“Andy!” Nina calls out.",
  "“Come meet Millie!”",
  "",
  "This must be Andrew Winchester.",
  "When I was googling the Winchester family, my eyes popped out a bit when I saw this man’s net worth.",
  "After seeing all those dollar signs, the home theater and the gate surrounding the property made a bit more sense.",
  "He’s a businessman, who took over his father’s thriving company, and has doubled the profits since.",
  "But it’s obvious from his surprised expression that he allows his wife to handle most of the household matters, and it’s apparently flat out slipped her mind to tell him she’s hired a live-in housekeeper.",
  "",
  "“Hello…” Mr. Winchester steps into the living room, his brow furrowed.",
  "“Millie, is it?",
  "I’m sorry, I didn’t realize…”",
  "",
  "“Andy, I told you about her!”",
  "She tilts her head to the side.",
  "“I said we needed to hire somebody to help with cleaning and cooking and Cecelia.",
  "I’m sure I told you!”",
  "",
  "“Yes, well.”",
  "His face finally relaxes.",
  "“Welcome, Millie.",
  "We could certainly use the help.”",
  "",
  "Andrew Winchester holds his hand out for me to shake.",
  "It’s hard not to notice he is an incredibly handsome man.",
  "Piercing brown eyes, a full head of hair the color of mahogany, and a sexy little cleft in his chin.",
  "It’s also hard not to notice that he is several levels more attractive than his wife, even with her impeccable grooming, which strikes me as a bit strange.",
  "The man is filthy rich, after all.",
  "He could have any woman he wants.",
  "I respect him for not choosing a twenty-year-old supermodel to be his life partner.",
  "",
  "I thrust my new phone into my jeans pocket and reach out to take his hand.",
  "“Nice to meet you, Mr. Winchester.”",
  "",
  "“Please.”",
  "He smiles warmly at me.",
  "“Call me Andrew.”",
  "",
  "As he says the words, something flickers over Nina Winchester’s face.",
  "Her lips twitch and her eyes narrow.",
  "I’m not exactly sure why though.",
  "She herself offered to let me call her by her first name.",
  "And it’s not like Andrew Winchester is checking me out.",
  "His eyes are staying respectfully on mine and not dropping below the neck.",
  "Not that there’s much to see—even though I didn’t bother with the fake tortoiseshell glasses today, I’m wearing a modest blouse and comfortable blue jeans for my first day of work.",
  "",
  "“Anyway,” Nina snips, “don’t you have to get to the office, Andy?”",
  "",
  "“Oh yes.”",
  "He straightens out his gray tie.",
  "“I’ve got a meeting at nine-thirty in the city.",
  "I better hurry.”",
  "",
  "Andrew gives Nina a lingering kiss on the lips and squeezes her shoulder.",
  "As far as I can see, they are quite happily married.",
  "And Andrew seems pretty down-to-earth for a man whose net worth has eight figures after the dollar sign.",
  "It’s sweet how he blows her a kiss from the front door—this is a man who loves his wife.",
  "",
  "“Your husband seems nice,” I say to Nina as the door slams shut.",
  "",
  "The dark, suspicious look returns to her eyes.",
  "“Do you think so?”",
  "",
  "“Well, yes,” I stammer.",
  "“I mean, he seems like… how long have you been married?”",
  "",
  "Nina looks at me thoughtfully.",
  "But instead of answering my question, she says, “What happened to your glasses?”",
  "",
  "“What?”",
  "",
  "She lifts an eyebrow.",
  "“You were wearing a pair of glasses at your interview, weren’t you?”",
  "",
  "“Oh.”",
  "I squirm, reluctant to admit that the eyeglasses were fake—my attempt to look more intelligent and serious, and yes, less attractive and threatening.",
  "“I… uh, I’m wearing my contacts.”",
  "",
  "“Are you?”",
  "",
  "I don’t know why I lied.",
  "I should’ve just said that I don’t need the glasses that badly.",
  "Instead, I have now doubled down and invented contacts that I’m not actually wearing.",
  "I can feel Nina scrutinizing my pupils, searching for the lenses.",
  "",
  "“Is… is that a problem?” I finally ask.",
  "",
  "A muscle twitches under her right eye.",
  "For a moment, I’m scared she’s going to tell me that I should get out.",
  "But then her face relaxes.",
  "“Of course not!",
  "I just thought those glasses were so cute on you.",
  "Very striking—you should wear them more often.”",
  "",
  "“Yes, well…” I grab the handle of one of my duffel bags with my shaking hand.",
  "“Maybe I should get my stuff upstairs so I can get started.”",
  "",
  "Nina claps her hands together.",
  "“Excellent idea!”",
  "",
  "Once again, Nina doesn’t offer to take either of my bags as we climb up the two flights of stairs to get to the attic.",
  "By halfway through the second flight, my arms feel like they’re about ready to fall off, but Nina doesn’t seem interested in pausing to give me a moment to readjust the straps.",
  "I gasp with relief when I’m able to drop the bags on the floor of my new room.",
  "Nina yanks on the cord to turn on the two lightbulbs that illuminate my tiny living space.",
  "",
  "“I hope it’s okay,” Nina says.",
  "“I figure you’d rather have the privacy of being up here, as well as your own bathroom.”",
  "",
  "Maybe she feels guilty about the fact that their ginormous guestroom is lying empty while I am living in a room slightly larger than a broom closet.",
  "But that’s fine.",
  "Anything larger than the backseat of my car is like a palace.",
  "I can’t wait to sleep here tonight.",
  "I’m obscenely grateful.",
  "",
  "“It’s perfect,” I say honestly.",
  "",
  "In addition to the bed, dresser, and bookcase, I notice one other thing in the room that I didn’t see the first time around.",
  "A little mini-fridge, about a foot tall.",
  "It’s plugged into the wall and humming rhythmically.",
  "I crouch down and tug it open.",
  "",
  "The mini-fridge has two small shelves.",
  "And on the top shelf, there are three tiny bottles of water.",
  "",
  "“Good hydration is very important,” Nina says earnestly.",
  "",
  "“Yes…”",
  "",
  "When she sees the perplexed expression on my face, she smiles.",
  "“Obviously, it’s your fridge and you can put whatever you want in it.",
  "I thought I would give you a head start.”",
  "",
  "“Thank you.”",
  "It’s not that strange.",
  "Some people leave mints on a pillow.",
  "Nina leaves three tiny bottles of water.",
  "",
  "“Anyway…” Nina wipes her hands on her thighs, even though her hands are spotless.",
  "“I’ll let you get unpacked and then get started cleaning the house.",
  "I’ll be preparing for my PTA meeting tomorrow.”",
  "",
  "“PTA?”",
  "",
  "“Parent Teacher Association.”",
  "She beams at me.",
  "“I’m the vice president.”",
  "",
  "“That’s wonderful,” I say, because it’s what she wants to hear.",
  "Nina is very easy to please.",
  "“I’ll just unpack everything quickly and get right to work.”",
  "",
  "“Thank you so much.”",
  "Her fingers briefly touch my bare arm—hers are warm and dry.",
  "“You’re a lifesaver, Millie.",
  "I’m so glad you’re here.”",
  "",
  "I rest my hand on the doorknob as Nina starts to leave my room.",
  "And that’s when I notice it.",
  "What’s been bothering me about this room from the moment I first walked in here.",
  "A sick feeling washes over me.",
  "",
  "“Nina?”",
  "",
  "“Hmm?”",
  "",
  "“Why…” I clear my throat.",
  "“Why is the lock to this bedroom on the outside rather than the inside?”",
  "",
  "Nina peers down at the doorknob, as if noticing it for the first time.",
  "“Oh!",
  "I’m so sorry about that.",
  "We used to use this room as a closet, so obviously we wanted it to lock from the outside.",
  "But then I converted it to a bedroom for the hired help, and I guess we never switched the lock.”",
  "",
  "If somebody wanted, they could easily lock me in here.",
  "And there’s only that one window, looking out at the back of the house.",
  "This room could be a death trap.",
  "",
  "But then again, why would anyone want to lock me in here?",
  "",
  "“Could I have the key to the room?” I ask.",
  "",
  "She shrugs.",
  "“I’m not even sure where it is.”",
  "",
  "“I’d like a copy.”",
  "",
  "Her light blue eyes narrow at me.",
  "“Why?",
  "What do you expect to be keeping in your room that you don’t want us to know about?”",
  "",
  "My mouth falls open.",
  "“I…. Nothing, but…”",
  "",
  "Nina throws her head back and laughs.",
  "“I’m just kidding.",
  "It’s your room, Millie!",
  "If you want a key, I’ll get you one.",
  "I promise.”",

  "Sometimes it feels like Nina has a split personality.",
  "She flips from hot to cold so rapidly.",

  "I’d like to lock it, but I can’t.",
  "Obviously.",

  "As I shut the door, I notice marks in the wood.",
  "Long thin lines running down the length of the door at about the level of my shoulder.",
  "I run my fingers over the indentations.",
  "They almost seem like…",

  "Scratches.",
  "Like somebody was scraping at the door.",

  "Trying to get out.",
  "",
  "No, that’s ridiculous.",
  "I’m being paranoid.",
  "Sometimes old wood gets scratched up.",
  "It doesn’t mean anything ominous.",
  "",
  "The room suddenly feels unbearably hot and stuffy.",
  "There’s a small furnace in the corner of the room, which I’m sure keeps it comfortable in the winter, but there’s nothing to cool it down in the warmer months.",
  "I’ll have to buy a fan to prop up in front of the window.",
  "Even though it’s way larger than my car, it’s still a very small space—I’m not surprised they used it as a storage closet.",
  "I look around, opening the drawers to check their size.",
  "There’s a little closet within the room, with just barely enough space to hang up my few dresses.",
  "The closet is empty except for a couple of hangers and a small blue bucket in the corner.",

  "I attempt to wrench open the small window to get a bit of air.",
  "But it doesn’t budge.",

  "I could ask Nina about it, but I don’t want it to seem like I’m complaining when I just started working here today.",

  "”Jadi aku…” Aku menunjuk ke dadaku.",
  "”Aku bekerja.",
  "Untuk Nyonya Winchester.”",
  "Aku menunjuk ke rumah itu.",
  "”Dan aku harus… masuk.”",
  "Sekarang aku menunjuk ke kunci di gerbang.",
  "”Masuk.”",
  "",
  "Ia hanya mengerutkan dahi padaku.",
  "Bagus.",
  "",
  "Aku baru saja akan mengeluarkan ponselku dan menelepon Nina ketika ia menepi, menekan semacam tombol, dan gerbang pun terbuka, nyaris dalam gerakan lambat.",
  "",
  "Setelah gerbang terbuka, aku menyempatkan diri sejenak untuk menatap rumah yang akan menjadi tempat tinggalku untuk waktu yang akan datang.",
  "Rumah itu berlantai dua ditambah loteng, membentang seluas kira-kira satu blok kota di Brooklyn.",
  "Warnanya putih menyilaukan—mungkin baru dicat—dan arsitekturnya terlihat kontemporer, tapi apa yang kutahu?",
  "Aku hanya tahu sepertinya orang-orang yang tinggal di sini punya lebih banyak uang daripada yang mereka tahu harus diapakan.",
  "",
  "Aku mulai mengambil salah satu tasku, tapi sebelum sempat, pria itu mengangkat keduanya tanpa mengerang sedikit pun dan membawanya ke pintu depan untukku.",
  "Tas-tas itu sangat berat—isinya benar-benar semua yang kumiliki selain mobilku—jadi aku berterima kasih ia sukarela melakukan pekerjaan berat ini untukku.",
  "",
  "”Gracias,” kataku.",
  "",
  "Ia memberiku tatapan aneh.",
  "Hmm, sepertinya itu bahasa Spanyol.",
  "Sudahlah.",
  "",
  "Aku menunjuk ke dadaku.",
  "”Millie,” kataku.",
  "",
  "”Millie.”",
  "Ia mengangguk mengerti, lalu menunjuk ke dadanya sendiri.",
  "”Aku Enzo.”",
  "",
  "”Senang bertemu denganmu,” kataku canggung, meskipun ia tidak akan mengerti.",
  "Tapi astaga, jika ia tinggal di sini dan punya pekerjaan, ia pasti sudah sedikit bisa berbahasa Inggris.",
  "",
  "”Piacere di conoscerti,” katanya.",
  "",
  "Aku mengangguk tanpa kata.",
  "Pupus sudah harapanku untuk berteman dengan si tukang kebun.",
  "",
  "”Millie,” katanya lagi dengan aksen Italia yang kental.",
  "Sepertinya ia ingin mengatakan sesuatu, tapi kesulitan dengan bahasanya.",
  "”Kau…”",
  "",
  "Ia mendesiskan sepatah kata dalam bahasa Italia, tapi begitu kami mendengar pintu depan mulai dibuka, Enzo bergegas kembali ke tempat ia berjongkok di halaman depan dan menyibukkan diri.",
  "Aku nyaris tidak bisa mendengar kata yang ia ucapkan.",
  "Pericolo.",
  "Entah apa artinya.",
  "Mungkin artinya dia ingin minuman ringan.",
  "Peri cola—sekarang dengan perasan jeruk nipis!",
  "",
  "”Millie!” Nina tampak senang melihatku.",
  "Saking senangnya ia langsung memelukku erat-erat.",
  "”Aku senang sekali kau memutuskan untuk mengambil pekerjaan ini.",
  "Aku merasa kita punya ikatan.",
  "Kau tahu, kan?”",
  "",
  "Itulah yang kupikirkan.",
  "Ia punya ”firasat” tentangku, jadi ia tidak repot-repot melakukan riset.",
  "Sekarang aku hanya perlu memastikan ia tidak pernah punya alasan untuk tidak mempercayaiku.",
  "Aku harus menjadi pegawai yang sempurna.",
  "”Ya, aku tahu maksudmu.",
  "Aku juga merasakan hal yang sama.”",
  "",
  "”Nah, masuklah!”",
  "",
  "Nina menggandeng sikuku dan membawaku masuk ke dalam rumah, tidak peduli dengan fakta bahwa aku sedang kerepotan dengan dua koperku.",
  "Bukannya aku berharap ia akan membantuku.",
  "Pasti tidak akan terpikir olehnya.",
  "",
  "Aku tidak bisa tidak memperhatikan saat masuk ke dalam bahwa rumah itu terlihat sangat berbeda dari saat pertama kali aku di sini.",
  "Sangat berbeda.",
  "Saat aku datang untuk wawancara, rumah Winchester sangat bersih—aku bisa makan dari permukaan mana pun di ruangan itu.",
  "Tapi sekarang, tempat itu terlihat seperti kandang babi.",
  "Meja kopi di depan sofa dihiasi enam cangkir dengan berbagai jumlah cairan lengket yang berbeda di dalamnya, sekitar selusin koran dan majalah yang kusut, serta sebuah kotak piza yang penyok.",
  "Ada pakaian dan sampah berserakan di seluruh ruang keluarga dan meja makan masih menyisakan sisa makan malam semalam.",
  "",
  "”Seperti yang kau lihat,” kata Nina, “kau datang di saat yang sangat tepat!”",
  "",
  "Jadi Nina Winchester itu jorok—itulah rahasianya.",
  "Butuh berjam-jam bagiku untuk membuat tempat ini menjadi layak.",
  "Mungkin berhari-hari.",
  "Tapi tidak apa-apa—aku sudah gatal ingin melakukan kerja keras yang jujur.",
  "Dan aku suka ia membutuhkanku.",
  "Jika aku bisa membuat diriku tak ternilai baginya, kecil kemungkinannya ia akan memecatku jika—atau saat—ia mengetahui kebenarannya.",
  "",
  "”Biar kutaruh tasku dulu,” kataku padanya.",
  "”Lalu aku akan membereskan seluruh tempat ini.”",
  "",
  "Nina menghela napas lega.",
  "”Kau adalah keajaiban, Millie.",
  "Terima kasih banyak.",
  "Juga…” Ia mengambil tasnya dari meja dapur dan mengaduk-aduk isinya, akhirnya mengeluarkan iPhone terbaru.",
  "”Aku membelikanmu ini.",
  "Aku tidak bisa tidak memperhatikan kau menggunakan ponsel yang sangat ketinggalan zaman.",
  "Jika aku perlu menghubungimu, aku ingin kau punya alat komunikasi yang bisa diandalkan.”",
  "",
  "Aku dengan ragu melingkarkan jari-jariku di sekitar iPhone baru itu.",
  "”Wow.",
  "Ini sangat murah hati, tapi aku tidak mampu membayar paket datanya—”",
  "",
  "Ia melambaikan tangan.",
  "”Aku sudah menambahkanmu ke paket keluarga kami.",
  "Harganya hampir tidak ada.”",
  "",
  "Hampir tidak ada?",
  "Aku punya firasat definisinya tentang dua kata itu sangat berbeda dari definisiku.",
  "",
  "Sebelum aku bisa protes lebih jauh, suara langkah kaki menggema di tangga di belakangku.",
  "Aku berbalik, dan seorang pria berjas abu-abu sedang menuruni tangga.",
  "Ketika ia melihatku berdiri di ruang keluarga, ia berhenti mendadak di dasar tangga, seolah terkejut dengan kehadiranku.",
  "Matanya semakin melebar saat ia melihat koperku.",
  "",
  "”Andy!” panggil Nina.",
  "”Sini, kenalan dengan Millie!”",
  "",
  "Ini pasti Andrew Winchester.",
  "Saat aku mencari tahu tentang keluarga Winchester di Google, mataku sedikit melotot saat melihat kekayaan bersih pria ini.",
  "Setelah melihat semua tanda dolar itu, bioskop pribadi dan gerbang yang mengelilingi properti itu menjadi sedikit lebih masuk akal.",
  "Ia seorang pengusaha, yang mengambil alih perusahaan ayahnya yang sedang berkembang, dan telah melipatgandakan keuntungannya sejak saat itu.",
  "Tapi jelas dari ekspresi terkejutnya bahwa ia membiarkan istrinya menangani sebagian besar urusan rumah tangga, dan tampaknya istrinya benar-benar lupa memberitahunya bahwa ia telah mempekerjakan seorang asisten rumah tangga yang tinggal di rumah.",
  "",
  "”Halo…” Tuan Winchester melangkah ke ruang keluarga, alisnya berkerut.",
  "”Millie, ya?",
  "Maaf, aku tidak tahu…”",
  "",
  "”Andy, aku sudah memberitahumu tentang dia!”",
  "Ia memiringkan kepalanya ke samping.",
  "”Aku bilang kita perlu mempekerjakan seseorang untuk membantu bersih-bersih, memasak, dan mengurus Cecelia.",
  "Aku yakin sudah memberitahumu!”",
  "",
  "”Ya, baiklah.”",
  "Wajahnya akhirnya rileks.",
  "”Selamat datang, Millie.",
  "Kami benar-benar butuh bantuan.”",
  "",
  "Andrew Winchester mengulurkan tangannya untuk kujabat.",
  "Sulit untuk tidak memperhatikan bahwa ia adalah pria yang luar biasa tampan.",
  "Mata cokelat yang tajam, rambut lebat berwarna mahoni, dan belahan dagu kecil yang seksi.",
  "Juga sulit untuk tidak memperhatikan bahwa ia beberapa tingkat lebih menarik daripada istrinya, bahkan dengan penampilan istrinya yang tanpa cela, yang menurutku agak aneh.",
  "Pria itu kaya raya, bagaimanapun juga.",
  "Ia bisa mendapatkan wanita mana pun yang ia inginkan.",
  "Aku menghargainya karena tidak memilih supermodel berusia dua puluh tahun untuk menjadi pasangan hidupnya.",
  "",
  "Kumasukkan ponsel baruku ke saku jins dan mengulurkan tangan untuk menyambut tangannya.",
  "”Senang bertemu dengan Anda, Tuan Winchester.”",
  "",
  "”Tolong.”",
  "Ia tersenyum hangat padaku.",
  "”Panggil saja Andrew.”",
  "",
  "Saat ia mengucapkan kata-kata itu, sesuatu berkelebat di wajah Nina Winchester.",
  "Bibirnya berkedut dan matanya menyipit.",
  "Aku tidak begitu yakin kenapa.",
  "Ia sendiri yang menawariku untuk memanggilnya dengan nama depannya.",
  "Dan bukan berarti Andrew Winchester sedang mengamatiku.",
  "Matanya tetap tertuju dengan sopan pada mataku dan tidak turun ke bawah leher.",
  "Bukan berarti ada banyak yang bisa dilihat—meskipun aku tidak repot-repot memakai kacamata tempurung kura-kura palsu hari ini, aku mengenakan blus sederhana dan celana jins biru yang nyaman untuk hari pertamaku bekerja.",
  "",
  "”Pokoknya,” sela Nina tajam, “bukankah kau harus ke kantor, Andy?”",
  "",
  "”Oh ya.”",
  "Ia merapikan dasi abu-abunya.",
  "”Aku ada rapat jam setengah sepuluh di kota.",
  "Sebaiknya aku bergegas.”",
  "",
  "Andrew memberi Nina ciuman lama di bibir dan meremas bahunya.",
  "Sejauh yang kulihat, mereka adalah pasangan yang sangat bahagia.",
  "Dan Andrew tampak cukup membumi untuk seorang pria yang kekayaan bersihnya memiliki delapan angka di belakang tanda dolar.",
  "Manis sekali caranya mengirimkan ciuman dari pintu depan—ini adalah pria yang mencintai istrinya.",
  "",
  "”Suamimu kelihatannya baik,” kataku pada Nina saat pintu terbanting menutup.",
  "",
  "Tatapan gelap dan curiga kembali ke matanya.",
  "”Begitu, ya?”",
  "",
  "”Yah, ya,” aku tergagap.",
  "”Maksudku, dia kelihatannya… sudah berapa lama kalian menikah?”",
  "",
  "Nina menatapku dengan penuh pertimbangan.",
  "Tapi alih-alih menjawab pertanyaanku, ia berkata, “Ke mana kacamatamu?”",
  "",
  "”Apa?”",
  "",
  "Ia mengangkat alis.",
  "”Kau memakai kacamata saat wawancara, kan?”",
  "",
  "”Oh.”",
  "Aku gelisah, enggan mengakui bahwa kacamata itu palsu—usahaku untuk terlihat lebih cerdas dan serius, dan ya, tidak terlalu menarik dan mengancam.",
  "”Aku… uh, aku memakai lensa kontak.”",
  "",
  "”Benarkah?”",
  "",
  "Aku tidak tahu kenapa aku berbohong.",
  "Seharusnya aku bilang saja bahwa aku tidak terlalu membutuhkan kacamata itu.",
  "Sebaliknya, aku sekarang malah bersikeras dan mengarang cerita tentang lensa kontak yang sebenarnya tidak kupakai.",
  "Aku bisa merasakan Nina mengamati pupil mataku, mencari lensa kontak itu.",
  "",
  "”Apa… apa itu masalah?” akhirnya aku bertanya.",
  "",
  "Sebuah otot berkedut di bawah mata kanannya.",
  "Sesaat, aku takut ia akan menyuruhku pergi.",
  "Tapi kemudian wajahnya rileks.",
  "”Tentu saja tidak!",
  "Aku hanya berpikir kacamata itu sangat manis untukmu.",
  "Sangat menarik—kau harus lebih sering memakainya.”",
  "",
  "”Ya, baiklah…” Aku meraih pegangan salah satu tas jinjingku dengan tangan gemetar.",
  "”Mungkin sebaiknya aku membawa barang-barangku ke atas agar bisa segera mulai.”",
  "",
  "Nina menepukkan tangannya.",
  "”Ide bagus!”",
  "",
  "Sekali lagi, Nina tidak menawarkan untuk membawa tasku saat kami menaiki dua lantai tangga menuju loteng.",
  "Di pertengahan tangga kedua, lenganku terasa seperti akan copot, tapi Nina sepertinya tidak tertarik untuk berhenti sejenak memberiku waktu untuk menyesuaikan tali tas.",
  "Aku terkesiap lega saat bisa meletakkan tas-tas itu di lantai kamar baruku.",
  "Nina menarik tali untuk menyalakan dua bola lampu yang menerangi ruang tinggalku yang mungil.",
  "",
  "”Kuharap tidak apa-apa,” kata Nina.",
  "”Kukira kau lebih suka privasi di atas sini, juga kamar mandimu sendiri.”",
  "",
  "Mungkin ia merasa bersalah karena kamar tamu mereka yang sangat besar kosong sementara aku tinggal di kamar yang sedikit lebih besar dari lemari sapu.",
  "Tapi tidak apa-apa.",
  "Apa pun yang lebih besar dari kursi belakang mobilku sudah seperti istana.",
  "Aku tidak sabar untuk tidur di sini malam ini.",
  "Aku sangat bersyukur.",
  "",
  "”Ini sempurna,” kataku jujur.",
  "",
  "Selain tempat tidur, lemari laci, dan rak buku, aku melihat satu hal lain di ruangan itu yang tidak kulihat pertama kali.",
  "Sebuah kulkas mini, tingginya sekitar tiga puluh sentimeter.",
  "Tersambung ke dinding dan berdengung berirama.",
  "Aku berjongkok dan menariknya hingga terbuka.",
  "",
  "Kulkas mini itu memiliki dua rak kecil.",
  "Dan di rak atas, ada tiga botol air kecil.",
  "",
  "”Hidrasi yang baik sangat penting,” kata Nina dengan sungguh-sungguh.",
  "",
  "”Ya…”",
  "",
  "Saat ia melihat ekspresi bingung di wajahku, ia tersenyum.",
  "”Tentu saja, itu kulkasmu dan kau bisa menaruh apa pun yang kau mau di dalamnya.",
  "Kupikir aku akan memberimu sedikit permulaan.”",
  "",
  "”Terima kasih.”",
  "Tidak terlalu aneh.",
  "Beberapa orang meninggalkan permen mint di atas bantal.",
  "Nina meninggalkan tiga botol air kecil.",
  "",
  "”Pokoknya…” Nina mengusap tangannya ke pahanya, meskipun tangannya bersih tanpa noda.",
  "”Aku akan membiarkanmu membongkar barang dan kemudian mulai membersihkan rumah.",
  "Aku akan mempersiapkan rapat Komite Sekolahku besok.”",
  "",
  "”Komite Sekolah?”",
  "",
  "”Persatuan Orang Tua dan Guru.”",
  "Ia tersenyum cerah padaku.",
  "”Aku wakil ketuanya.”",
  "",
  "”Bagus sekali,” kataku, karena itulah yang ingin ia dengar.",
  "Nina sangat mudah disenangkan.",
  "”Aku akan membongkar semuanya dengan cepat dan langsung bekerja.”",
  "",
  "”Terima kasih banyak.”",
  "Jarinya menyentuh lenganku yang telanjang sejenak—jarinya hangat dan kering.",
  "”Kau penyelamatku, Millie.",
  "Aku senang sekali kau ada di sini.”",
  "",
  "Kutaruh tanganku di gagang pintu saat Nina mulai meninggalkan kamarku.",
  "Dan saat itulah aku menyadarinya.",
  "Apa yang telah menggangguku tentang ruangan ini sejak pertama kali aku masuk.",
  "Perasaan mual menyelimutiku.",
  "",
  "”Nina?”",
  "",
  "”Hmm?”",
  "",
  "”Kenapa…” Aku berdeham.",
  "”Kenapa kunci kamar tidur ini ada di luar, bukan di dalam?”",
  "",
  "Nina menatap gagang pintu, seolah baru pertama kali menyadarinya.",
  "”Oh!",
  "Maaf sekali soal itu.",
  "Dulu kami menggunakan ruangan ini sebagai lemari, jadi tentu saja kami ingin menguncinya dari luar.",
  "Tapi kemudian aku mengubahnya menjadi kamar tidur untuk asisten rumah tangga, dan kurasa kami tidak pernah mengganti kuncinya.”",
  "",
  "Jika seseorang mau, mereka bisa dengan mudah mengunciku di sini.",
  "Dan hanya ada satu jendela itu, yang menghadap ke belakang rumah.",
  "Kamar ini bisa menjadi perangkap maut.",
  "",
  "Tapi sekali lagi, mengapa ada orang yang ingin mengunciku di sini?",
  "",
  "”Bolehkah aku minta kunci kamarnya?” tanyaku.",
  "",
  "Ia mengangkat bahu.",
  "”Aku bahkan tidak yakin di mana kuncinya.”",
  "",
  "”Aku ingin duplikatnya.”",
  "",
  "Mata biru mudanya menyipit ke arahku.",
  "”Kenapa?",
  "Apa yang kau harapkan akan kau simpan di kamarmu yang tidak ingin kami ketahui?”",
  "",
  "Mulutku ternganga.",
  "”Aku…. Tidak ada, tapi…”",
  "",
  "Nina tertawa terbahak-bahak.",
  "”Aku hanya bercanda.",
  "Ini kamarmu, Millie!",
  "Jika kau mau kunci, akan kuberikan.",
  "Aku janji.”",
  "",
  "Terkadang rasanya Nina punya kepribadian ganda.",
  "Sikapnya berubah dari ramah menjadi dingin begitu cepat.",
  "Ia mengaku hanya bercanda, tapi aku tidak begitu yakin.",
  "Tapi itu tidak penting.",
  "Aku tidak punya pilihan lain dan pekerjaan ini adalah berkah.",
  "Aku akan membuatnya berhasil.",
  "Apa pun yang terjadi.",
  "Aku akan membuat Nina Winchester menyukaiku.",
  "",
  "Setelah Nina meninggalkan kamarku, kututup pintu di belakangnya.",
  "Aku ingin menguncinya, tapi tidak bisa.",
  "Jelas saja.",
  "",
  "Saat aku menutup pintu, aku melihat bekas-bekas di kayunya.",
  "Garis-garis tipis panjang membentang di sepanjang pintu setinggi bahuku.",
  "Kuraba lekukan-lekukan itu.",
  "Hampir terlihat seperti…",
  "",
  "Goresan.",
  "Seperti seseorang sedang menggaruk pintu.",

  "Mencoba keluar.",

  "Tidak, itu konyol.",
  "Aku hanya paranoid.",
  "Terkadang kayu tua memang tergores.",
  "Itu tidak berarti sesuatu yang tidak menyenangkan.",
  "",
  "Ruangan itu tiba-tiba terasa sangat panas dan pengap.",
  "Ada tungku kecil di sudut ruangan, yang kuyakini membuatnya nyaman di musim dingin, tapi tidak ada yang bisa mendinginkannya di bulan-bulan yang lebih hangat.",
  "Aku harus membeli kipas angin untuk diletakkan di depan jendela.",
  "Meskipun jauh lebih besar dari mobilku, ini masih ruang yang sangat kecil—aku tidak heran mereka menggunakannya sebagai lemari penyimpanan.",
  "Aku melihat sekeliling, membuka laci untuk memeriksa ukurannya.",
  "Ada lemari kecil di dalam kamar, dengan ruang yang nyaris tidak cukup untuk menggantung beberapa gaunku.",
  "Lemari itu kosong kecuali beberapa gantungan baju dan sebuah ember biru kecil di sudut.",
  "",
  "Aku mencoba membuka jendela kecil itu untuk mendapatkan sedikit udara.",
  "Tapi tidak bergerak.",
  "Aku menyipitkan mata untuk menyelidiki lebih dekat.",
  "Kusapukan jariku di sepanjang bingkai jendela.",
  "Sepertinya jendela itu sudah dicat mati.",
  "",
  "Meskipun aku punya jendela, jendela itu tidak bisa dibuka.",
  "",
  "Aku bisa bertanya pada Nina tentang itu, tapi aku tidak ingin terlihat seperti sedang mengeluh padahal baru mulai bekerja hari ini.",
  "Mungkin minggu depan aku bisa menyinggungnya.",
  "Kurasa tidak berlebihan jika berharap punya satu jendela yang berfungsi.",

  "Tukang kebun itu, Enzo, ada di halaman belakang sekarang.",
  "Ia sedang menyalakan mesin pemotong rumput di sana.",
  "Ia berhenti sejenak untuk menyeka keringat dari dahinya dengan lengan bawahnya yang berotot, lalu ia mendongak.",
  "Ia melihat wajahku melalui jendela kecil itu, dan ia menggelengkan kepala, sama seperti saat pertama kali aku bertemu dengannya.",
  "Aku ingat kata yang ia desiskan padaku dalam bahasa Italia sebelum aku masuk ke rumah.",
  "Pericolo.",
  "",
  "Kukeluarkan ponsel baruku dari saku.",
  "Layarnya menyala begitu disentuh, dipenuhi ikon-ikon kecil untuk pesan teks, panggilan, dan cuaca.",
  "Ponsel semacam ini belum ada di mana-mana saat awal aku dipenjara, dan aku belum mampu membelinya sejak aku keluar.",
  "Tapi beberapa gadis punya satu di rumah singgah tempat aku tinggal saat pertama kali keluar, jadi aku sedikit tahu cara menggunakannya.",
  "Aku tahu ikon mana yang membuka peramban.",

  "Setiap malam ia menyanyikan lagu yang sama: ”Somewhere Over the Rainbow” dari *The Wizard of Oz*.",
  "Suara Nina tidak terdengar seperti ia punya pelatihan vokal, tapi ada sesuatu yang anehnya indah dan menghantui dari cara ia bernyanyi untuk Cecelia.",
  "",
  "Setelah Cecelia tidur, Nina membaca atau menonton televisi di kamar tidur.",
  "Andrew menyusul ke atas tak lama kemudian.",
  "Jika aku turun setelah pukul sepuluh malam, lantai pertama benar-benar kosong.",
  "",
  "Jadi pada malam ini aku memutuskan untuk memanfaatkannya.",
  "",
  "Inilah sebabnya aku berbaring di sofa, menonton sebuah episode *Family Feud*.",
  "Saat itu hampir pukul satu pagi, jadi tingkat energi para kontestan yang tinggi terasa hampir aneh.",
  "Steve Harvey sedang bercanda dengan mereka, dan meskipun aku sangat lelah, aku tertawa terbahak-bahak saat salah satu kontestan bangkit untuk menunjukkan keahlian menari tap-nya.",
  "Dulu aku sering menonton acara ini saat masih kecil, dan aku selalu membayangkan diriku ikut serta; aku tidak yakin siapa yang akan kuajak.",
  "Orang tuaku, aku—itu tiga orang.",
  "Siapa lagi yang bisa kuajak?",
  "",
  "”Itu *Family Feud*?”",
  "",
  "Aku sontak mendongak.",
  "Meskipun sudah tengah malam, entah bagaimana Andrew Winchester berdiri di belakangku, sama terjaganya seperti orang-orang di layar televisi.",
  "",
  "Sial.",
  "Aku tahu seharusnya aku tetap di kamarku.",
  "",
  "”Oh!” kataku.",
  "”Aku, uh… maaf.",
  "Aku tidak bermaksud…”",
  "",
  "Ia menaikkan sebelah alisnya.",
  "”Untuk apa kau minta maaf?",
  "Kau juga tinggal di sini.",
  "Kau berhak menonton televisi.”",
  "",
  "Kuambil sebuah bantal dari sofa untuk menutupi celana pendek olahragaku yang tipis yang kupakai untuk tidur.",
  "Juga, aku tidak memakai bra.",
  "”Aku tadinya mau membeli satu set untuk kamarku.”",
  "",
  "”Tidak apa-apa menggunakan monitor kami, Millie.",
  "Kau mungkin tidak akan dapat banyak sinyal di atas sana.”",
  "Bagian putih matanya bersinar dalam cahaya televisi.",
  "”Aku akan segera pergi.",
  "Aku hanya mau mengambil segelas air.”",
  "",
  "Aku duduk di sofa, memeluk bantal ke dadaku, ragu apakah aku harus naik ke atas.",
  "Aku tidak akan bisa tidur sekarang karena jantungku berdebar kencang.",
  "Ia bilang ia hanya mengambil air, jadi mungkin aku bisa tetap di sini.",
  "Kuperhatikan ia berjalan ke dapur dan kudengar suara keran air mengalir.",
  "",
  "Ia kembali ke ruang keluarga, menyesap gelas airnya.",
  "Saat itulah aku sadar ia hanya mengenakan kaus dalam putih dan celana boxer.",
  "Tapi setidaknya ia tidak bertelanjang dada.",
  "",
  "”Kenapa kau mengambil air dari keran?” aku tak bisa menahan diri untuk bertanya.",
  "",
  "Ia duduk di sebelahku di sofa, meskipun kuharap ia tidak melakukannya.",
  "”Apa maksudmu?”",
  "",
  "Akan sangat tidak sopan jika aku melompat dari sofa, jadi aku hanya bergeser sejauh yang kubisa.",
  "Hal terakhir yang kuinginkan adalah Nina melihat kami berdua bermesraan di sofa dengan pakaian dalam kami.",
  "”Maksudku, kau tidak menggunakan filter air di kulkas.”",
  "",
  "Ia tertawa.",
  "”Aku tidak tahu.",
  "Aku selalu mengambil air dari keran.",
  "Memangnya, apa itu beracun?”",
  "",
  "”Aku tidak tahu.",
  "Kurasa ada bahan kimianya.”",
  "",
  "Ia menyisir rambut gelapnya dengan tangan hingga sedikit berdiri.",
  "”Entah kenapa aku lapar.",
  "Ada sisa makan malam di kulkas?”",
  "",
  "”Tidak ada, maaf.”",
  "",
  "”Hmm.”",
  "Ia mengusap perutnya.",
  "”Apa akan sangat tidak sopan jika aku makan selai kacang langsung dari stoplesnya?”",
  "",
  "Aku meringis mendengar kata selai kacang.",
  "”Asal kau tidak makan di depan Cecelia.”",
  "",
  "Ia memiringkan kepalanya.",
  "”Kenapa?”",
  "",
  "”Kau tahu.",
  "Karena dia alergi.”",
  "Mereka benar-benar tidak terlihat menghormati alergi kacang Cecelia yang mematikan di rumah ini.",
  "",
  "Yang lebih mengejutkan lagi, Andrew tertawa.",
  "”Tidak, kok.”",
  "",
  "”Ya, dia alergi.",
  "Dia bilang begitu padaku.",
  "Di hari pertama aku di sini.”",
  "",
  "”Um, kurasa aku akan tahu jika putriku alergi kacang.”",
  "Ia mendengus.",
  "”Lagipula, apa kau pikir kami akan menyimpan stoples besar selai kacang di dapur jika dia alergi?”",
  "",
  "Itulah persisnya yang kupikirkan saat Cecelia memberitahuku tentang alerginya.",
  "Apa ia hanya mengarang cerita untuk menyiksaku?",
  "Bukan tidak mungkin.",
  "Tapi sekali lagi, Nina juga bilang Cecelia punya alergi kacang.",
  "Apa yang terjadi di sini?",
  "Tapi argumen Andrew adalah yang paling masuk akal: fakta bahwa ada stoples besar selai kacang di dapur menunjukkan tidak ada seorang pun di sini yang punya alergi kacang yang mematikan.",
  "",
  "”Bluberi,” kata Andrew.",
  "",
  "Aku mengerutkan kening.",
  "”Kurasa tidak ada bluberi di kulkas.”",
  "",
  "”Bukan.”",
  "Ia menunjuk ke layar televisi, di mana *Family Feud* telah memasuki babak kedua.",
  "”Mereka mensurvei seratus orang dan meminta mereka menyebutkan buah yang bisa dimasukkan utuh ke dalam mulut.”",
  "",
  "Kontestan di layar menjawab bluberi, dan itu adalah jawaban nomor satu.",
  "Andrew mengepalkan tangannya.",
  "”Lihat?",
  "Aku tahu.",
  "Aku pasti akan hebat di acara ini.”",
  "",
  "”Jawaban teratas selalu mudah ditebak,” kataku.",
  "”Bagian yang sulit adalah mendapatkan jawaban yang lebih tidak umum.”",
  "",
  "”Oke, sok tahu.”",
  "Ia menyeringai ke arahku.",
  "”Sebutkan buah yang bisa kau masukkan utuh ke dalam mulut.”",
  "",
  "”Um…” Kukutuk-ketuk daguku dengan jari.",
  "”Anggur.”",
  "",
  "Benar saja, kontestan berikutnya menjawab ”anggur” dan jawabannya benar.",
  "",
  "”Aku tarik kata-kataku,” katanya.",
  "”Kau juga jago dalam hal ini.",
  "Oke, bagaimana dengan stroberi?”",
  "",
  "”Mungkin ada di daftar,” kataku, “meskipun kau tidak akan benar-benar mau memasukkan stroberi utuh ke dalam mulut karena ada batangnya dan lain-lain.”",
  "",
  "Para kontestan berhasil menyebutkan stroberi dan ceri, tapi mereka macet di jawaban terakhir.",
  "Andrew tertawa terbahak-bahak saat salah satu dari mereka menyebut buah persik.",
  "",
  "”Persik!” serunya.",
  "”Siapa yang bisa memasukkan buah persik ke dalam mulut?",
  "Kau harus melepaskan rahangmu!”",
  "",
  "Aku terkikik.",
  "”Masih lebih baik daripada semangka.”",
  "",
  "”Itu mungkin jawabannya!",
  "Aku yakin sekali.”",
  "",
  "Jawaban terakhir di papan ternyata adalah buah prem.",
  "Andrew menggelengkan kepala.",
  "”Aku tidak begitu yakin soal itu.",
  "Aku ingin lihat foto para kontestan yang bilang mereka bisa memasukkan buah prem utuh ke dalam mulut.”",
  "",
  "”Itu seharusnya jadi bagian dari acaranya,” kataku.",
  "”Kau bisa mendengar dari seratus orang yang disurvei dan mendapatkan alasan di balik jawaban mereka.”",
  "",
  "”Kau harus menulis surat ke *Family Feud* dan menyarankannya,” katanya dengan serius.",
  "”Kau bisa merevolusi seluruh acara itu.”",
  "",
  "Aku terkikik lagi.",
  "Saat pertama kali bertemu Andrew, kukira ia adalah pria kaya yang kaku.",
  "Tapi ia sama sekali tidak seperti itu.",
  "Nina memang benar-benar gila, tapi Andrew baik.",
  "Ia sangat membumi, dan ia lucu.",
  "Dan sepertinya ia adalah ayah yang sangat baik bagi Cecelia.",
  "",
  "Sejujurnya, terkadang aku merasa sedikit kasihan padanya.",
  "",
  "Seharusnya aku tidak berpikir begitu.",
  "Nina adalah bosku.",
  "Ia memberiku gaji dan tempat tinggal.",
  "Kesetiaanku adalah padanya.",
  "Tapi di saat yang sama, ia ужасен.",
  "Ia jorok, ia terus-menerus memberiku informasi yang bertentangan, dan ia bisa sangat kejam.",
  "Bahkan Enzo, yang badannya pasti seratus kilogram otot padat, tampak takut padanya.",
  "",
  "Tentu saja, aku mungkin tidak akan merasa begitu jika Andrew tidak begitu menarik.",
  "Meskipun aku sudah duduk sejauh mungkin darinya tanpa jatuh dari sofa, aku tidak bisa tidak memikirkan fakta bahwa ia sedang mengenakan pakaian dalamnya saat ini.",
  "Ia mengenakan celana boxernya.",
  "Dan bahan kaus dalamnya cukup tipis sehingga aku bisa melihat garis bentuk otot-otot yang sangat seksi.",
  "Ia bisa mendapatkan yang jauh lebih baik dari Nina.",
  "",
  "Aku jadi bertanya-tanya apa ia sadar akan hal itu.",
  "",
  "Tepat saat aku mulai rileks dan senang Andrew bergabung denganku di bawah sini, sebuah suara melengking membuyarkan lamunanku:",
  "”Astaga, lelucon besar apa yang sedang kalian tertawakan di bawah sini?”",
  "",
  "Aku sontak menoleh.",
  "Nina berdiri di kaki tangga, menatap kami.",
  "Saat ia memakai sepatu haknya, aku bisa mendengarnya datang dari jauh, tapi ia ternyata sangat ringan langkahnya saat bertelanjang kaki.",
  "Ia mengenakan gaun tidur putih yang jatuh hingga ke pergelangan kakinya, dan lengannya terlipat di depan dada.",
  "",
  "”Hei, Nina.”",
  "Andrew menguap dan bangkit dari sofa.",
  "”Kenapa kau bangun?”",
  "",
  "Nina menatap kami tajam.",
  "Aku tidak tahu kenapa Andrew tidak panik sekarang.",
  "Aku sendiri sebentar lagi akan mengompol.",
  "Tapi ia tampak sama sekali tidak peduli dengan fakta bahwa istrinya baru saja memergoki kami berdua sendirian di ruang keluarga pada pukul satu pagi, keduanya dalam pakaian dalam kami.",
  "Bukan berarti kami sedang melakukan sesuatu, tapi tetap saja.",
  "",
  "”Aku bisa menanyakan hal yang sama padamu,” balas Nina.",
  "”Kalian berdua sepertinya sedang bersenang-senang.",
  "Apa leluconnya?”",
  "",
  "Andrew mengangkat bahu.",
  "”Aku turun untuk mengambil air dan Millie sedang menonton televisi di sini.",
  "Aku jadi teralihkan oleh *Family Feud*.”",
  "",
  "”Millie.”",
  "Nina mengalihkan perhatiannya padaku.",
  "”Kenapa kau tidak membeli televisi untuk kamarmu sendiri?",
  "Ini ruang keluarga.”",
  "",
  "”Maaf,” kataku cepat.",
  "”Aku akan membeli televisi pada kesempatan berikutnya.”",
  "",
  "”Hei.”",
  "Andrew menaikkan alisnya.",
  "”Apa salahnya Millie menonton sedikit televisi di sini jika tidak ada orang?”",
  "",
  "”Yah, kau ada di sini.”",
  "",
  "”Dan dia tidak menggangguku.”",
  "",
  "”Bukankah kau ada rapat besok pagi?”",
  "Mata Nina menusuknya.",
  "”Apa kau benar-benar harus bangun menonton televisi pada pukul satu pagi?”",
  "",
  "Ia menarik napas.",
  "Aku menahan napasku sendiri, berharap sejenak ia akan melawannya.",
  "Tapi kemudian bahunya merosot.",
  "”Kau benar, Nina.",
  "Sebaiknya aku tidur.”",
  "",
  "Nina berdiri di sana, lengannya terlipat di depan dadanya yang bidang, memperhatikan Andrew berjalan menaiki tangga, seolah ia adalah anak kecil yang ia suruh tidur tanpa makan malam.",
  "Melihat tingkat kecemburuannya membuatku tidak nyaman.",
  "",
  "Aku bangkit dari sofa juga dan mematikan televisi.",
  "Nina masih berlama-lama di dasar tangga.",
  "Matanya menelusuri celana pendek olahraga dan kaus singletku.",
  "Aku yang tidak memakai bra.",
  "Sekali lagi, terpikir olehku betapa buruknya ini kelihatannya.",
  "Tapi kukira aku akan sendirian di bawah sini.",
  "",
  "”Millie,” kata Nina, “di kemudian hari, aku harap kau mengenakan pakaian yang pantas di sekitar rumah.”",
  "",
  "”Maaf sekali,” kataku untuk kedua kalinya.",
  "”Aku tidak menyangka akan ada yang bangun.”",
  "",
  "”Benarkah?”",
  "Ia mendengus.",
  "”Apa kau akan begitu saja berkeliaran di rumah orang asing di tengah malam karena kau berasumsi mereka tidak akan ada?”",
  "",
  "Aku tidak tahu harus berkata apa.",
  "Ini bukan rumah orang asing.",
  "Aku tinggal di sini, meskipun di loteng.",
  "”Tidak…”",
  "",
  "”Tolong tetap di loteng setelah waktu tidur,” katanya.",
  "”Sisa rumah ini untuk keluargaku.",
  "Kau mengerti?”",
  "",
  "”Aku mengerti.”",
  "",
  "Ia menggelengkan kepala.",
  "”Jujur saja, aku bahkan tidak yakin seberapa besar kita butuh seorang pembantu.",
  "Mungkin ini sebuah kesalahan…”",
  "",
  "Oh, tidak.",
  "Apa ia akan memecatku pada pukul satu pagi karena aku menonton televisi di ruang keluarganya?",
  "Ini buruk.",
  "Dan tidak ada kemungkinan Nina akan memberiku rekomendasi yang baik untuk pekerjaan lain.",
  "Ia sepertinya lebih seperti tipe orang yang akan menelepon setiap calon majikan untuk memberitahu mereka betapa ia membenciku.",
  "",
  "Aku harus memperbaiki ini.",
  "",
  "Kutancapkan kuku jariku ke telapak tanganku.",
  "”Dengar, Nina,” aku memulai.",
  "”Tidak ada apa-apa antara aku dan Andrew…”",
  "",
  "Ia tertawa terbahak-bahak.",
  "Itu suara yang mengganggu, sesuatu antara tawa dan tangisan.",
  "”Apa itu yang kau pikir aku khawatirkan?",
  "Andrew dan aku adalah belahan jiwa.",
  "Kami punya seorang anak bersama dan tak lama lagi kami akan punya bayi lagi.",
  "Kau pikir aku takut suamiku akan mempertaruhkan segalanya dalam hidupnya untuk seorang pembantu rendahan yang tinggal di loteng?”",

  "Aku menelan ludah.",

  "This Saturday afternoon, Nina is throwing a small PTA gathering in her backyard.",
  "They’re meeting up to plan something called “field day” in which the kids play in a field for a few hours, and somehow it takes months of planning to prepare for it.",
  "Nina has been talking about it nonstop lately.",
  "And she has texted me no less than a dozen times to remind me to pick up the hors d’oeuvres.",
  "",
  "I’m starting to get stressed because, as usual, the entire house was a mess when I woke up this morning.",
  "I don’t know how this house gets so messy.",
  "Is Nina’s medication treating some sort of disorder where she gets up in the middle of the night and makes a mess in the house?",
  "Is that a thing?",
  "",
  "I don’t know how the bathrooms get so bad overnight, for example.",
  "When I come into her bathroom to clean in the morning, there are usually at least three or four towels strewn on the floor, sopping wet.",
  "There’s usually toothpaste caked into the sink that I have to scrub to get free.",
  "Nina has some sort of aversion to throwing her clothes in the laundry basket, so it takes me a good ten minutes to gather her bra, underwear, pants, pantyhose, etc.",
  "Thank God Andrew is better at getting his clothing in the laundry basket.",
  "Then there’s the stuff that needs to be dry cleaned, of which there is a lot.",
  "Nina doesn’t distinguish between the two, and God forbid I make the wrong decision about what goes in the laundry machine and what needs to be run to the dry cleaner.",
  "That would be a hanging offense.",
  "",
  "The other thing is the food wrappers.",
  "I find candy wrappers stuffed into nearly every crevice in her bedroom and bathroom.",
  "I suppose that explains why Nina is fifty pounds heavier than she was in the photographs of when she and Andrew first met.",
  "",
  "By the time I have cleaned the house top to bottom, dropped off the dry cleaning, and completed the laundry and the ironing, I’m running very short on time.",
  "The women are going to arrive within the hour, and I’m still not done with all the tasks Nina assigned me, including picking up the hors d’oeuvres.",
  "She’s not going to understand if I try to explain that to her.",
  "Considering she nearly fired me last week when she caught me watching Family Feud with Andrew, I can’t afford to make any mistakes.",
  "I’ve got to make sure this afternoon is perfect.",
  "",
  "Then I get to the backyard.",
  "The Winchesters’ backyard is one of the most beautiful sights in the neighborhood.",
  "Enzo has done his job well—the hedges are trimmed so precisely, it’s like he used a ruler.",
  "Flowers dot the edges of the yard, adding a pop of color.",
  "And the grass is so lush and green, I’m half tempted to lie down in it, waving my arms around to make grass angels.",
  "",
  "But apparently, they don’t spend much time out here, because all the patio furniture has a thick layer of dust on it.",

  "“It would be incredibly helpful if you could pick up the hors d’oeuvres.”",

  "“Done.”",

  "It feels like a giant weight has been lifted from my shoulders.",
  "It was going to take me twenty minutes to get to the store to pick up the hors d’oeuvres and twenty minutes to get back.",

  "Andy and I have been married for three months, and sometimes I have to pinch myself.",
  "Our courtship was quick.",
  "Before I met Andy, all the men I dated just wanted to play games.",
  "But Andy wasn’t about games.",
  "From the night of our magical first date, he made his intentions clear to me.",
  "He was looking for a serious relationship.",
  "He had been engaged before, a year earlier, to a woman named Kathleen, but it hadn’t worked out.",
  "He was ready to get married.",
  "He was willing to take on both me and Cecelia.",
  "",
  "And from my perspective, he was everything I was looking for.",
  "I wanted a secure home for me and my daughter.",
  "I wanted a man with a steady job, who would be a father figure for my little girl.",
  "I wanted a man who was kind and responsible and… well, yes, attractive.",
  "Andy checked off every single box.",
  "",
  "In the days leading up to our wedding, I kept looking for flaws.",
  "Nobody could possibly be as perfect as Andy Winchester.",
  "He had to have a secret gambling problem or maybe a whole other family stashed away in Utah.",
  "I even contemplated calling Kathleen, the former fiancée.",
  "He’d shown me photographs of her—she had blond hair like me and a sweet face—but I didn’t know her last name and I couldn’t locate her on social media.",
  "But at least she wasn’t talking trash about him all over the internet.",
  "I took that as a good sign.",
  "",
  "The only thing about Andy that isn’t ideal is… well, his mother.",
  "Evelyn Winchester is around a little bit more than I would like.",
  "And I wouldn’t call her the warmest person in the world.",
  "Despite Andy’s assurance that she “loves babies” and is “thrilled” to watch Cece, she always seems a bit put out when we ask her to babysit.",
  "And the evening invariably concludes with a set of criticisms of my parenting, thinly veiled as “suggestions.”",
  "",
  "But I am marrying Andy, not his mother.",
  "No one likes their mother-in-law, right?",
  "I can deal with Evelyn, especially since she doesn’t have that much interest in me in general outside my apparent lack of parenting skills.",
  "If that’s the only thing wrong with Andy, I’m in good shape.",
  "",
  "So I married him.",
  "",
  "And even three months later, I haven’t quite come down from my cloud yet.",
  "I can’t believe that I have the financial stability to stay home with my little girl.",
  "I do want to go back to graduate school eventually, but right now I want to soak up every minute of my family.",
  "Cece and Andy.",
  "How could one woman get so lucky?",
  "",
  "And in return, I try to be a perfect wife.",
  "In my little free time, I work out at the gym to make sure I’m in perfect shape.",
  "I bought a wardrobe of absolutely impractical white clothing because he adores me in white.",
  "I’ve studied recipes online and I’m trying to cook for him as much as I can.",
  "I want to be worthy of this incredible life he’s given me.",
  "",
  "Tonight I kiss Cecelia on her baby-smooth cheek, taking a few extra seconds to stare down at her and take in the sound of her deep breathing and the scent of baby powder.",
  "I tuck a strand of her soft blond hair between one of her nearly translucent ears.",
  "She is so beautiful.",
  "I love her so much, sometimes I feel like I could just eat her up.",
  "",
  "When I come out of her bedroom, Andy is waiting for me outside.",
  "He is smiling at me, his dark hair without even a strand out of place, every bit as gorgeous as that first day I met him.",
  "I still don’t understand why he picked me.",
  "He could have had any woman in the world.",
  "Why me?",
  "",
  "But maybe I shouldn’t question it.",
  "I should just be happy.",
  "",
  "“Hey,” he says.",
  "He tucks a strand of my own blond hair behind my ear.",
  "“I can see your roots starting to show a bit.”",
  "",
  "“Oh.”",
  "I touch my hairline self-consciously.",
  "Andy loves blond hair, so I started going to the salon after we got engaged to lighten my hair to more of a golden shade.",
  "“Gosh, I guess I’ve been so busy with Cece, it just slipped my mind.”",
  "",
  "I can’t quite read the expression on his face.",
  "He’s still smiling, but there’s something off about it.",
  "It doesn’t bother him that much that I missed a hair appointment, does it?",
  "",
  "“Listen,” he says.",
  "“I need your help with something first.”",
  "",
  "I lift an eyebrow, glad he doesn’t seem too upset about my hair.",
  "“Sure.",
  "What is it?”",
  "",
  "He raises his eyes in the direction of the ceiling.",
  "“There are some papers from work that I stashed in the upstairs storage area.",
  "I was wondering if you could help me try to find them.",
  "I’ve got to get this contract done tonight.",
  "And then after, we can…”",
  "He grins at me.",
  "“You know.”",
  "",
  "He doesn’t have to tell me twice.",
  "",
  "I’ve been living in this house for about four months now, and I’ve never been up to the storage area in the attic.",
  "I climbed the stairs up there once, while Cece was taking a nap, but the door was locked, so I turned back.",
  "Andy says it’s just a bunch of papers.",
  "Nothing too exciting.",
  "",
  "And the truth is, I don’t love going up there.",
  "I don’t have any crazy phobias about attics, but the staircase leading up there is kind of creepy.",
  "It’s dark, and the stairs creak with every step.",
  "As I follow Andy up the staircase, I stay close to him.",
  "",
  "When we get to the top of the stairs, Andy leads me down the small hallway to the locked door at the end.",
  "He gets out his set of keys and fits one of the small ones into the lock.",
  "Then he throws the door open and tugs on a cord to turn on the light.",
  "",
  "I blink as my eyes adjust to the light and I take in my surroundings.",
  "This is not a storage closet like I thought it would be.",
  "It’s more like a tiny room, with a cot pushed up into one corner.",
  "There’s even a little dresser and a mini-fridge.",
  "There’s a single tiny window at the far end of the room.",
  "",
  "“Oh.”",
  "I scratch my chin.",
  "“This is a room.",
  "I thought it would just be junk and storage stuff.”",

  "",
  "I walk over to the closet and peer inside.",
  "There’s nothing inside except a blue bucket.",

  "I lift my head and turn around.",
  "Suddenly, I’m all alone in this tiny room.",

  "“Andy?”",
  "I call out.",
  "",
  "I cross the room in two strides and reach for the doorknob.",

  "That’s the only explanation.",
  "I pat my pockets, but my phone is in the bedroom.",
  "There’s no way to call him.",

  "Damn it.",

  "My eyes fall on the window.",
  "There’s one tiny little window in the corner of the room.",
  "I walk over and look outside, realizing that the window looks out on to the backyard.",
  "So there’s no way to get anybody’s attention outside.",
  "I’m stuck here until Andy returns.",
  "",
  "I’m not exactly claustrophobic, but this room is very small with a low ceiling that slants over the bed.",
  "And the idea that I’m locked in here is starting to freak me out.",
  "Yes, Andy will come back shortly, but I don’t like this enclosed space.",
  "My breathing quickens and my fingertips start to tingle.",

  "I push against the bottom of the window, but the window doesn’t budge.",
  "Not even a millimeter.",

  "I don’t even know what papers he wants.",

  "Satu-satunya hal tentang Andy yang kurang ideal adalah… yah, ibunya.",
  "Kehadiran Evelyn Winchester sedikit lebih sering daripada yang kuinginkan.",

  "",
  "Tapi aku menikahi Andy, bukan ibunya.",
  "Tidak ada yang suka ibu mertuanya, kan?",

  "",
  "Aku tidak bisa membaca ekspresi wajahnya.",

  "",
  "Aku mengerjap saat mataku menyesuaikan diri dengan cahaya dan aku mengamati sekelilingku.",

  "Kuperiksa saku bajuku, tapi ponselku ada di kamar tidur.",
  "Tidak ada cara untuk meneleponnya.",

  "Sialan.",
  "",
  "Mataku tertuju pada jendela.",

  "I crack the window open in Suzanne’s Audi so that the wind tousles my light hair as she drives me home from our lunch date.",
  "We were supposed to be discussing PTA issues, but we got distracted and started gossiping.",
  "It’s hard not to gossip.",
  "There are so many bored housewives in this town.",
  "",
  "People think I’m one of them.",
  "",
  "Andy and I have been married for seven years now.",
  "And he has kept every one of his promises.",
  "He has, in many ways, been a wonderful husband.",
  "He has supported me financially, he has been a father figure to Cecelia, he’s even-tempered and agreeable.",
  "He doesn’t drink heavily or mess around behind my back like so many other men in this town.",
  "He’s almost perfect.",
  "",
  "And I hate his guts.",
  "",
  "I have done everything I possibly can to get out of this marriage.",
  "I bargained with him.",
  "I told him I would leave with just Cecelia and the clothing on my back, but he just laughed.",
  "With my history of mental health problems, it would be easy for him to tell the police I’d kidnapped Cece and was going to hurt her again.",
  "I tried playing the part of the perfect wife, hoping not to give him an excuse to take me up to the attic.",
  "I cooked delicious homemade dinners, kept the house spotless, and even pretended not to be repulsed when we had sex.",
  "But he always found something.",
  "Something I never would have even imagined I did wrong.",
  "",
  "Eventually, I gave up.",
  "I wasn’t going to try to be nice if it didn’t even affect how often he took me up there.",
  "My new strategy became to repel him.",
  "I started behaving like a shrew, snapping at him for every little thing that annoyed me.",
  "He didn’t care—he almost seemed to enjoy the abuse.",
  "I stopped going to the gym and started eating whatever the hell I wanted, hoping if I couldn’t turn him off with my behavior, I could turn him off with my appearance.",
  "On one occasion, he caught me indulging in a chocolate cake and he dragged me up to the attic and starved me for two days as a punishment.",
  "But after that, he didn’t seem to care anymore.",
  "",
  "I tried finding Kathleen, his former fiancé, hoping she might back up my story so that I could finally go to the police without sounding like a crazy person.",
  "I had an idea of what she looked like and her approximate age—I thought I could find her.",
  "But do you know how many people roughly aged thirty to thirty-five have the name Kathleen?",
  "Quite a lot.",
  "I couldn’t find her.",
  "I finally gave up trying.",
  "",
  "On average, he makes me go up to the attic once every other month.",
  "Sometimes it’s more frequent, sometimes less.",
  "Once six months went by without a trip up there.",
  "I don’t know if it’s better or worse that I don’t know when it’s coming.",
  "It would be awful if I knew the exact day and had to dread it, but it’s also awful to never know if I’ll be spending that night in my own bed or in that uncomfortable cot.",
  "And of course, I never know what sort of torture he’s got waiting for me in the room because I never know what transgression I have committed.",
  "",
  "And it’s not just me.",
  "If Cecelia does something unacceptable, I’m the one who gets punished.",
  "He has purchased a wardrobe of itchy, frilly dresses that she hates, that the other children make fun of her for wearing, but she knows if she doesn’t wear them or gets them dirty, her mother will disappear for days (likely naked, to teach me clothing is a privilege).",
  "So she obeys.",
  "",
  "I’m scared that someday he will start punishing her instead, but in the meantime, I’m happy to accept my fate if he spares my daughter.",
  "",
  "And he’s very clear that if I try to get away from him, Cecelia will pay the price.",
  "He already almost drowned her.",
  "His other favorite way to taunt me is keeping a jar of peanut butter in our pantry, even though he knows that she’s allergic.",
  "I have thrown it away dozens of times, and it always reappears—and sometimes I get punished for the transgression.",
  "Thankfully, it’s not a life-threatening allergy—she just breaks out in welts all over her body.",
  "Every once in a while, he slips a little bit into her dinner, just to prove a point when the itchy, uncomfortable rash sprouts after our meal has ended.",
  "",
  "If I knew I wouldn’t go to jail for it, I would pick up a steak knife and drive it through his neck.",
  "",
  "Andy has prepared for that contingency though.",
  "Of course, he knows that my temptation to arrange for his death or outright kill him myself might become overwhelming.",
  "He has informed me that in the event of his death from any cause, a letter will be sent from his attorney to the police department, informing them of my unstable behavior and homicidal threats against him.",
  "Not that he needs to do it, with my psychiatric history.",
  "",
  "So I stay with him.",
  "And I don’t murder him in his sleep.",
  "Or hire a hitman.",
  "But I do fantasize.",
  "When Cecelia is older, when she doesn’t need me, maybe I could get away.",
  "Then he won’t have a threat against me anymore.",
  "Once she is safe, I don’t care what happens to me.",
  "",
  "“Here we are!” Suzanne announces cheerfully as we pull up in front of the gate to our home.",
  "Funny how the first time I saw those gates, I thought how charming it was to have a home with a gate surrounding it.",
  "Now it seems like exactly what it is: a prison.",
  "",
  "“Thanks for the ride,” I say.",
  "Even though she didn’t thank me for paying for lunch.",
  "",
  "“You’re welcome,” she chirps.",
  "“Hopefully, Andrew will be home soon.”",
  "",
  "I grimace at the tinge of worry in her voice.",
  "A few years ago, when I was getting very close with Suzanne, we had a few too many drinks at her house and I confessed everything.",
  "Everything.",
  "I begged her to help me.",
  "I told her I wanted to go to the police, but I couldn’t.",
  "Not without anyone supporting me.",
  "",
  "We talked for hours.",
  "Suzanne had held my hand and sworn to me it was going to be okay.",
  "She told me to go home and we would figure this out together.",
  "I cried with relief, believing my nightmare was finally over.",
  "",
  "But when I got home, Andy was waiting for me.",
  "",
  "Apparently, every time I made a new friend, Andy sought out that friend.",
  "He sat down with them and clued them in to my history of mental health problems.",
  "He told them what I had tried to do years earlier.",
  "And he told them if they had any reason for concern to call him immediately.",
  "Because I might be having another episode.",
  "",
  "Unbeknownst to me, Suzanne had slipped away briefly during our conversation, under the guise of needing the bathroom, and she called Andy.",
  "She warned him that I was having delusions again.",
  "So when I came home, he was ready for me.",
  "It was another two-month stay at Clearview, where I discovered at least one of the directors was a golfing buddy of his father.",
  "",
  "When I got out, Suzanne apologized profusely.",
  "I was just worried about you, Nina.",
  "I’m so glad you got help.",
  "I forgave her, of course.",
  "She was tricked the same way I was.",
  "But it was never the same between us again after that.",
  "And I was never able to trust anyone ever again.",
  "",
  "“So I’ll see you Friday, right?” Suzanne says.",
  "“At the school play.”",
  "",
  "“Sure,” I say.",
  "“What time does it start again?”",
  "",
  "Suzanne doesn’t answer me, suddenly distracted by something.",
  "",
  "“Does it start at seven?” I press her.",
  "",
  "“Mm-hmm,” she says.",
  "",
  "I glance over her shoulder to see what has grabbed her attention.",
  "I roll my eyes when I figure it out.",
  "It’s Enzo, the local landscaper who we hired to work on our yard a couple of months ago.",
  "He does a good job—always works hard and never makes excuses—and he’s admittedly pretty easy on the eyes.",
  "But it’s crazy the way everyone who comes to our house when he’s working slobbers over him and then suddenly remembers they have some yard work they need done.",
  "",
  "“Wow,” Suzanne breathes.",
  "“I heard your yard guy was hot, but damn.”",
  "",
  "I roll my eyes.",
  "“He just works on our lawn—that’s it.",
  "He doesn’t even speak English.”",
  "",
  "“I’m okay with that,” Suzanne says.",
  "“Hell, that might be a plus.”",
  "",
  "She won’t let up until I hand over Enzo’s phone number.",
  "Not that I mind.",
  "He seems like a nice enough guy, and I’m glad he’s getting some extra business.",
  "Even if it’s only because he’s hot, and not because of what he does.",
  "",
  "When I get out of the car and pass through the gates, Enzo looks up from his hedge clippers and waves his hand in greeting.",
  "“Ciao, Señora.”",
  "",
  "I return his smile.",
  "“Ciao, Enzo.”",
  "",
  "I like Enzo.",
  "Even though he doesn’t speak any English, he seems like a kind person—you can just tell.",
  "He plants all these beautiful flowers in our yard.",
  "Cece sometimes watches him, and when she asks him about the flowers, he patiently points to them and says their names.",
  "She repeats the names, and he nods and smiles.",
  "A few times she asked if she could help him, and he looked at me and asked, “Is okay?”",
  "When I agreed, he gave her a job to do in the flower bed, even though it probably slowed him down.",
  "",
  "He has tattoos all over his upper arms, mostly concealed by his shirt.",
  "One time when I was watching him work, I saw the name Antonia etched in a heart on his biceps.",
  "It made me wonder who Antonia was.",
  "I’m pretty sure Enzo isn’t married.",
  "",
  "There’s something about him.",
  "If only he spoke English, I feel like I could confide in him.",
  "That he might be the one person who would believe me.",
  "Who might actually help me.",
  "",
  "I stand there, watching him clip our hedges.",
  "I haven’t worked since the day I moved in here—Andy won’t let me.",
  "I miss it.",
  "Enzo would understand.",
  "I know he would.",
  "Too bad he doesn’t speak any English.",
  "But in a way, that makes it easier to confide in him.",
  "Sometimes I feel like if I don’t say the words out loud, I’m going to lose my mind for real.",
  "",
  "“My husband is a monster,” I say aloud.",
  "“He tortures me.",
  "He holds me hostage in the attic.”",
  "",
  "Enzo’s shoulders stiffen.",
  "He lowers his clippers, his brow furrowed.",
  "“Señora… Nina…”",
  "",
  "My stomach turns to ice.",
  "Why did I say that?",
  "I should never have said those words.",
  "It’s just that I knew he wouldn’t understand me, and I felt like I needed to tell somebody who wouldn’t rat me out to Andy.",
  "I thought it would be safe to tell Enzo.",
  "After all, he doesn’t even know English.",
  "But when I look into his dark eyes, there’s understanding there.",
  "",
  "“Never mind,” I say quickly.",
  "",
  "He takes a step toward me, and I shake my head, backing away.",
  "I made a huge mistake.",
  "Now I’m probably going to have to fire Enzo.",
  "",
  "But then he seems to get it.",
  "He picks up his clippers again and goes back to work.",
  "",
  "I hurry into the house as fast as I can and slam the door behind me.",
  "Right by the window, there’s a spectacular arrangement of flowers.",
  "I would say every color of the rainbow represented.",
  "Andy brought it home last night from work to surprise me, to show me what a spectacular husband he is when I am “well behaved.”",
  "",
  "I peer beyond the flowers out the window into the front yard.",
  "Enzo is still working out there, the sharp clippers in his gloved hands.",
  "But he pauses for a moment and looks up at the window.",

  "Aku dan Andy sudah menikah selama tujuh tahun sekarang.",
  "Dan ia telah menepati setiap janjinya.",
  "Dalam banyak hal, ia adalah suami yang luar biasa.",
  "Ia telah mendukungku secara finansial, ia telah menjadi figur ayah bagi Cecelia, ia sabar dan menyenangkan.",
  "Ia tidak minum berlebihan atau bermain di belakangku seperti banyak pria lain di kota ini.",
  "Ia nyaris sempurna.",

  "Aku sudah melakukan semua yang kubisa untuk keluar dari pernikahan ini.",
  "Aku bernegosiasi dengannya.",
  "Kukatakan padanya aku akan pergi hanya dengan Cecelia dan pakaian di badanku, tapi ia hanya tertawa.",
  "Dengan riwayat masalah kesehatan mentalku, akan mudah baginya memberitahu polisi bahwa aku menculik Cece dan akan menyakitinya lagi.",
  "Aku mencoba memainkan peran istri yang sempurna, berharap tidak memberinya alasan untuk membawaku ke loteng.",
  "Aku memasak makan malam rumahan yang lezat, menjaga rumah tetap bersih tanpa noda, dan bahkan berpura-pura tidak jijik saat kami berhubungan seks.",
  "Tapi ia selalu menemukan sesuatu.",
  "Sesuatu yang bahkan tidak pernah kubayangkan kulakukan salah.",
  "",
  "Akhirnya, aku menyerah.",
  "Aku tidak akan mencoba bersikap baik jika itu bahkan tidak memengaruhi seberapa sering ia membawaku ke atas sana.",
  "Strategi baruku adalah membuatnya jijik.",
  "Aku mulai berperilaku seperti nenek sihir, membentaknya untuk setiap hal kecil yang menggangguku.",
  "Ia tidak peduli—ia nyaris tampak menikmati pelecehan itu.",
  "Aku berhenti pergi ke gym dan mulai makan apa pun yang kuinginkan, berharap jika aku tidak bisa membuatnya jijik dengan perilakuku, aku bisa membuatnya jijik dengan penampilanku.",
  "Pada satu kesempatan, ia memergokiku sedang menikmati kue cokelat dan ia menyeretku ke loteng lalu membuatku kelaparan selama dua hari sebagai hukuman.",
  "Tapi setelah itu, ia tampaknya tidak peduli lagi.",

  "Rata-rata, ia menyuruhku naik ke loteng sekali setiap dua bulan.",
  "Terkadang lebih sering, terkadang lebih jarang.",
  "Pernah enam bulan berlalu tanpa kunjungan ke atas sana.",

  "Akan mengerikan jika aku tahu tanggal pastinya dan harus merasa takut, tapi juga mengerikan untuk tidak pernah tahu apakah aku akan menghabiskan malam itu di tempat tidurku sendiri atau di ranjang tidak nyaman itu.",
  "Dan tentu saja, aku tidak pernah tahu siksaan macam apa yang menungguku di kamar itu karena aku tidak pernah tahu pelanggaran apa yang telah kulakukan.",

  "Dan bukan hanya aku.",
  "Jika Cecelia melakukan sesuatu yang tidak bisa diterima, akulah yang dihukum.",
  "Andy telah membelikan lemari pakaian berisi gaun-gaun gatal dan berenda yang dibenci Cecelia, yang diejek oleh anak-anak lain karena memakainya, tapi ia tahu jika ia tidak memakainya atau mengotorinya, ibunya akan menghilang selama berhari-hari (kemungkinan telanjang, untuk mengajariku bahwa pakaian adalah sebuah keistimewaan).",
  "Jadi ia patuh.",

  "Aku takut suatu hari nanti Andy akan mulai menghukumnya sebagai gantinya, tapi sementara itu, aku senang menerima nasibku jika ia membiarkan putriku.",
  "",
  "Dan ia sangat jelas bahwa jika aku mencoba melarikan diri darinya, Cecelia akan menanggung akibatnya.",
  "Ia sudah hampir menenggelamkannya.",
  "Cara favoritnya yang lain untuk menyiksaku adalah menyimpan stoples selai kacang di dapur kami, meskipun ia tahu Cecelia alergi.",
  "Aku sudah membuangnya puluhan kali, dan selai kacang itu selalu muncul kembali—dan terkadang aku dihukum karena pelanggaran itu.",
  "Syukurlah, itu bukan alergi yang mengancam jiwa—Cecelia hanya mengalami bentol-bentol di sekujur tubuhnya.",
  "Sesekali, Andy menyelipkan sedikit ke dalam makan malamnya, hanya untuk membuktikan maksudnya saat ruam gatal dan tidak nyaman itu muncul setelah makan malam kami berakhir.",
  "",
  "Jika aku tahu aku tidak akan dipenjara karenanya, aku akan mengambil pisau steik dan menusukkannya ke lehernya.",
  "",
  "Tapi Andy sudah mempersiapkan kemungkinan itu.",
  "Tentu saja, ia tahu bahwa godaanku untuk merencanakan kematiannya atau langsung membunuhnya sendiri mungkin menjadi tak tertahankan.",
  "Ia telah memberitahuku bahwa jika ia meninggal karena sebab apa pun, sepucuk surat akan dikirim dari pengacaranya ke departemen kepolisian, memberitahu mereka tentang perilakuku yang tidak stabil dan ancaman pembunuhan terhadapnya.",
  "Bukannya ia perlu melakukannya, dengan riwayat kejiwaanku.",

  "It’s been an hour since Andrew was here.",
  "",
  "I used the bucket.",
  "I don’t want to talk about it.",
  "But it got to a point where if I didn’t use the bucket, I was going to have pee running down my legs.",
  "It was an interesting experience, to say the least.",
  "",
  "After I got that need taken care of, my stomach started rumbling.",
  "I checked the mini-fridge, where I usually keep a couple of snacks like yogurt.",
  "But somehow, it had been emptied in the last few days.",
  "The only thing left in there was three of those mini bottles of water.",
  "I chugged the contents of two of the bottles, although immediately after, I regretted it.",
  "What if he leaves me here for several more hours?",
  "Or days?",
  "I might need that water.",
  "",
  "I throw on my jeans and a fresh T-shirt, then I examine the pile of books on the floor.",
  "Andrew said he wanted me to keep those books resting on my belly for three hours and then he would let me out of the room.",
  "I don’t quite understand the purpose of this ridiculous game, but maybe I should just do it.",
  "Then he’ll let me out and I can get the hell out of here forever.",
  "",
  "I stretch out on the uncarpeted floor.",
  "It’s the beginning of summer, which means the attic is unbearably stuffy, but the floor is still cool.",
  "I rest my head against the ground and pick up the book on prisons.",
  "It’s a thick textbook that has got to weigh several pounds.",
  "I lower it onto my belly.",
  "",
  "It’s pressure, but not exactly uncomfortable.",
  "If I had done this before my trip to the bucket, I would probably have peed my pants by now.",
  "But this isn’t so bad.",
  "Then I pick up the second book.",
  "",
  "This is the one on torture.",
  "I suppose the title of this textbook isn’t entirely a coincidence.",
  "Or maybe it is.",
  "Who knows?",
  "",
  "I lower the second book onto my belly.",
  "This time the pressure becomes more uncomfortable.",
  "The books are heavy.",
  "And the protuberance of my scapula and my tailbone bite into the hard, uncarpeted floor.",
  "This isn’t enjoyable, but it’s tolerable.",
  "",
  "But he wanted all three books.",
  "",
  "I pick up the final book—the phonebook.",
  "This one is not only heavy, but bulky.",
  "It’s hard to even lift it with two other books already on top of me.",
  "It takes a couple of tries, but I manage to get the phonebook balanced on my abdomen.",
  "",
  "The weight of all three books almost takes my breath away.",
  "Two was doable, but three is awful.",
  "This is very, very uncomfortable.",
  "It’s hard to take a deep breath.",
  "And the edge of the bottom book bites into my rib cage.",
  "",
  "No, I can’t do it.",
  "I can’t.",
  "",
  "I shove all three books off me.",
  "My shoulders heave as I suck in air.",
  "He can’t expect me to keep all three books balanced on me for hours.",
  "Can he?",
  "",
  "I get back on my feet and immediately start pacing the room.",
  "I don’t know what game Andrew is playing here, but I’m not going to do this.",
  "He’s going to let me out of here.",
  "Or else I’m going to find a way out myself.",
  "There must be a way out of this room.",
  "This isn’t prison.",
  "",
  "Maybe there’s a way I can unscrew the door hinges.",
  "Or the screws on the doorknob.",
  "Andrew has a tool kit downstairs stashed in the garage, and I would give anything to get my hands on that right now.",
  "But I’ve got lots of stuff in my dresser drawers.",
  "Maybe there’s something I can use as a makeshift screwdriver.",
  "",
  "“Millie?”",

  "It’s Andrew’s voice again.",
  "I abandon my search for tools and rush over to the door.",

  "",
  "This time I can barely hear his footsteps retreating over the sound of my own screams.",
  "",
  "I have had the three books on my abdomen for two hours and fifty minutes.",
  "",
  "Andrew was right.",
  "After the third water bottle had been drained, my desperation to leave the room heightened considerably.",
  "When fantasies of waterfalls started dancing before my eyes, I knew I had to complete the task he wanted.",
  "Of course, there’s no guarantee he’ll let me out if I do it, but I hope he will.",
  "",
  "The books are really, really uncomfortable.",
  "I’m not going to lie.",
  "There are moments when I feel like I can’t stand it another second, that the weight is going to literally crush my pelvis, but then I take a breath—best I can with these stupid books on top of me—and I hang in there.",
  "It’s almost over.",
  "",
  "And when I get out of here…",
  "",
  "At the three-hour mark, I shove the books off of my belly.",
  "It’s a massive relief, but when I try to sit up, my abdomen aches badly enough to bring tears to my eyes.",
  "There are going to be bruises left behind.",
  "Still, I push forward and pound on the door.",
  "“I did it!”",
  "I yell.",
  "“I’m done!",
  "Let me out of here!”",
  "",
  "But of course, he doesn’t come.",
  "He might be able to see me, but I have no idea where he is.",
  "Is he in the house?",
  "At work?",
  "He could be anywhere.",
  "He knows where I am, but I don’t have the same privilege.",
  "",
  "That bastard.",
  "",
  "It’s an hour later when I hear footsteps outside my door.",
  "I want to cry with relief.",
  "I’ve never been claustrophobic before, but this experience has changed me.",
  "I’m not sure if I’ll be able to ride in elevators after this.",
  "",
  "“Millie?”",

  "“Right.",
  "But here’s the thing.",

  "My eyes fly open.",
  "If there were a moment when I would morph into the Incredible Hulk and rip the door right off by the hinges, that would be this moment.",

  "“Actually, I think there will be,” he says thoughtfully.",
  "“You’re on parole, right?",
  "If you were to take something from our house—and I’m sure Nina would back me up on that—where do you think you would end up?",
  "One offense and you’re right back in jail!",
  "Whereas you only have to stay in this room for a day or two every once in a while if you misbehave.",

  "Okay, this would be the moment I would turn into the Incredible Hulk.",

  "He hands it over to me, and for a moment, it hits me that he could’ve slipped some sort of drugs into the water, but I don’t even care.",

  "All of it.",

  "Aku tidak bisa menyangkal bagian itu.",

  "",
  "Aku yakin mereka akan mencoba menghubungi Millie, tapi aku mencoba mengeluarkannya dari daftar tersangka sebaik mungkin.",

  "It’s the Winchesters.",
  "",
  "I hold my breath as Evelyn and Robert Winchester enter the room.",
  "It’s the first time I’ve seen them since Andy’s death, but I knew this moment was coming.",
  "They had come back from Florida for the summer only a few weeks earlier, but Evelyn hadn’t stopped by yet.",
  "I spoke to her only once when she called me to ask if I needed help organizing the funeral.",
  "I told her I didn’t.",

  "Except the real truth was I wasn’t excited to talk to her after being responsible for the death of her only son.",
  "",
  "Detective Connors made good on all his promises.",
  "Andy’s death was ruled an accident, and neither I nor Millie was ever investigated.",
  "The story was that Andy accidentally got locked in the attic while I was away and died from dehydration.",
  "None of that explains the bruises and the missing teeth though.",
  "Detective Connors had friends in the coroner’s office, but the Winchesters are one of the most powerful and influential families in the state.",

  "I hardly know Robert, who is handsome like his son and wearing a dark suit today.",

  "“We know you’re all alone, and anything you need—you and Cecelia—you just have to ask.”",
  "",
  "“Thank you, Robert.”",
  "My eyes well up just a little bit.",
  "Robert was always a nice enough man, if not the greatest father of all time.",
  "From what Andy told me about him, he wasn’t around that much when he was a kid.",
  "Mostly worked while Evelyn raised him.",
  "“I appreciate that.”",
  "",
  "Robert reaches out and gently touches his son’s shoulder.",
  "I wonder if he had any idea what a monster Andy was.",
  "He had to have some idea.",
  "Or maybe Andy was just that good at hiding it.",
  "After all, I had no idea until I was scraping my fingernails against the wood of the attic door.",
  "",
  "Robert claps a hand over his mouth.",

  "Of all the people I wouldn’t want to be alone with today, Evelyn tops the list.",
  "Evelyn isn’t dumb.",

  "My stomach clenches.",
  "According to Detective Connors, the case is closed.",
  "Andy always taunted me about an alleged letter to the station police that would be sent over in case of his death, but no letter ever materialized.",
